parliament does not support amendment freeing tymoshenko
today , the ukraine parliament dismissed , within the code of criminal procedure amendment , the motion to revoke an article based on which the opposition leader , yulia tymoshenko , was sentenced .
the amendment that would lead to freeing the imprisoned former prime minister was revoked during second reading of the proposal for mitigation of sentences for economic offences .
in october , tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into what was reported to be a disadvantageous gas deal with russia .
the verdict is not yet final ; the court will hear tymoshenko 's appeal in december .
tymoshenko claims the verdict is a political <unk> of the regime ; in the west , the trial has also evoked suspicion of being biased .
the proposal to remove article 000 from the code of criminal procedure , upon which the former prime minister was sentenced , was supported by 000 members of parliament .
its ratification would require 000 votes .
libya 's victory
the story of libya 's liberation , or <unk> , already has its defeated .
<unk> <unk> is buried at an unknown place in the desert . without him , the war is over .
it is time to define the winners .
as a rule , islamists win in the country ; the question is whether they are the moderate or the radical ones .
the transitional cabinet declared itself a <unk> of the customary <unk> law , of which we have already heard .
libya will become a crime free country , as the punishment for stealing is having one 's hand <unk> .
women can forget about emancipation ; potential religious <unk> will be executed ; etc.
instead of a dictator , a society consisting of competing <unk> will be united by koran .
libya will be in an order we cannot imagine and surely would not ask for .
however , our lifestyle is neither unique nor the best one and would not , most probably , be suitable for , for example , the people of libya .
in fact , it is a wonder that the islamic fighters accepted help from the <unk> .
their only excuse is that from their point of view , nato <unk> were not controlled by an american general , but <unk> , the <unk> of whom they celebrated with each strike .
when winners are sought for in libya , the west is not on the list .
we participated in a shooting , served islam , and our politicians got rid of a dictator , their political ally , without any guarantee of profit .
given the recent bad experience from afghanistan and iraq , we decided against military occupation of libya .
the <unk> thus do not have to worry about expelling of the " <unk> . "
without the occupation , will the oil companies get libya 's black gold for next to nothing , though ?
it is quite likely that they will not . the west will then finally be able to boast about its <unk> protection of human rights .
unless the followers of the <unk> law put a stop to that .
new era of crisis commences
france and the rest of europe are now in the investors " spotlight .
a statistical storm <unk> over europe on tuesday .
individual countries released their <unk> gdp data .
between quarters , the czech economy stagnated ; germany and france are growing .
yet the <unk> market is breaking records today .
investors are no longer looking at only italy ; they now focus on spain , france , austria , and others .
eurozone statistical offices in germany , czech republic , and some other countries , released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter .
germany 's gdp has grown by the expected 0.0 % ; and france 's by 0.0 % .
both countries also adjusted their second quarter data , where germany did better than expected ( a 0.0 % increase instead of the original 0.0 % ) . france reported a slight decrease , by 0.0 % ( the original information suggested stagnation ) .
in this year 's third quarter , the czech economy showed an interim increase of 0.0 % .
between the quarters though , the gdp stagnated . according to the czech statistical office , this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowing of economic growth .
the results are worse than estimates by analysts .
key events :
in this year 's third quarter , czech economy showed an interim increase of 0.0 % ; however , it stagnated between the quarters .
based on preliminary and seasonal data , in the third quarter , the german economy grew by 0.0 % .
between july and september , the economy of both the eurozone and the european union grew , compared to the previous quarter , by 0.0 % , which corresponds with estimates by analysts .
the greek economy showed an interim decrease of 0.0 % .
the earnings on its 00 - year <unk> are 00.00 % .
earnings of both italian and spanish <unk> are growing towards critical limits .
even austria , netherlands , france , and belgium , etc. are beginning to experience problems .
despite the fact that the situation in the region is getting worse , earnings of czech 0 - year <unk> stay under 0 % .
voices are coming from germany , suggesting that ecb be the last resort creditor .
czechs qualified for euro .
in montenegro they won 0:0 and celebrate a 000 million windfall .
football representation successfully managed the <unk> task of the season !
thanks to both the great <unk> and beautiful goal of <unk> <unk> , they won 0:0 .
in the second half , czech football was lucky to maintain its luxury lead from the home return match , and will again feature at the european <unk> .
<unk> watched the progress match in a detailed report .
nearly no excitement in the first half , and a great portion of luck in the other .
czech representation team , partially due to the home team 's failure in the close ; the great <unk> ; and heroic <unk> ; won 0:0 in montenegro , and celebrates moving on to the european <unk> .
perfect czech team defence only allowed the montenegro team to threaten in the second half .
<unk> and <unk> became the match 's least lucky couple after losing two great opportunities .
the wonderful <unk> <unk> is one of the reasons the czech representation team will not miss the next year 's european <unk> . and czech football will thus gain nearly 000 million czech crowns .
from the opening minutes , the game was very <unk> .
both teams found it difficult to join in the combination ; the game remained around the mid - field line most of the time .
that was also why there was no pressure from the home team in the first half . long kicks behind the defence were neatly averted by the czech defence .
iranian students are prepared to die for their country 's nuclear program
they created a live shield .
several hundred university students created a live chain around the nuclear power plant in iran .
the gesture is to express their support of their country 's nuclear program against a possible israel attack .
at tuesday noon , students ' prayers in front of the building were followed by their <unk> of death to both the usa and israel .
in <unk> , iran , several hundred university students created a live chain around <unk> uranium conversion facility .
this way , they express their readiness to protect their country 's nuclear program with their own lives .
in its recent report , the international atomic energy agency ( <unk> ) stated that everything leads to the conclusion that iran has not stopped striving for a nuclear weapon .
possible attack on iran nuclear facilities has been discussed in israel .
at tuesday noon , students ' prayers in front of the entrance into <unk> uranium conversion facility were followed by their <unk> of death to both the usa and israel .
in case of an attack , aimed at the highest possible <unk> of the iranian nuclear program , the targets would be , based on israel press , the facilities in both <unk> and <unk> , where the uranium is being enriched .
an <unk> child 's diet : no breakfast and <unk> for <unk>
over a third of children between 0 and 00 are overweight ; while 0 % of schoolchildren are overweight , 0 % are <unk> .
as a recent research shows , <unk> children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle .
again , we can see the importance of the environment and models surrounding a human being for his or her healthy development .
for example , <unk> occur up to half more frequently on the tables of <unk> children compared to the families of children with standard weight .
over 00 % of <unk> children had <unk> chips for <unk> the day before the research connected to the educational event called obesity is no accident .
moreover , the families of <unk> children do not practise sports . however , this concerns a majority of families of current schoolchildren - only 00 % of the children said their parents find time for sports activities at least once a week .
the research was performed among 000 children .
the research took place at the end of last year 's school year ; it included almost 000 <unk> school children from throughout bohemia .
it was the second year of the obesity is no accident event supported by both <unk> <unk> <unk> insurance company and <unk> .
so far , the project has been joined by over 00 thousand school children from 0th to 0th grades .
proper diet and sufficient sports activities represent key defining factors causing dramatically growing number of children who are either overweight or <unk> .
" for example , only half of those <unk> said they have five <unk> a day , in the breakfast - <unk> - <unk> - <unk> - <unk> pattern , one of the basic preconditions of correct diet , " one of the results of the research says .
no <unk> and <unk> in the evening
experts warn that even relative details are crucial for healthy development ; such as a regular time of family breakfast .
in the czech republic , only 00 % of schoolchildren 's families have breakfast together .
in a majority of families , everyone has breakfast separately .
the worst discovery was the fact that in one tenth of households people do not have breakfast at all .
yet breakfast is the core of proper daily diet .
a survey has shown that <unk> are consumed more often in the families of <unk> children .
nearly everyone - regardless of their weight - drinks sweet soft drinks every day ( 00 % ) .
though over 00 % of children do sports regularly , the number drops down to less than a half - 00 % - when it comes to their parents .
<unk> your own menu
another part of the survey allowed selected children ( 000 boys and 000 girls from 00 schools ) to <unk> their own menu based on selection offered and their taste and opinions .
" diet preferences of czech children between 00 and 00 are far from ideal as regards healthy diet . "
their favourite <unk> include large number of flour , meat , and sweet dishes .
" especially alarming is the high popularity of sweet soft drinks , " the final report of the survey concludes .
as the main dish for <unk> , <unk> won very tightly over poultry .
however , children showed very little interest in <unk> , fish , and vegetable <unk> .
tendency towards health
the survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits provided they are given correct information .
" many participants from the survey control group showed a significant shift of preferences towards healthy food when completing a questionnaire after the end of the obesity is no accident educational <unk> , " project results show .
this was quite significant , for example , in case of sweet soft drinks , where more children would begin to prefer plain water .
in addition , for their main course , children <unk> poultry and fish more often , limiting sweet <unk> and <unk> .
a <unk> must also be a good psychologist , professionals claim
in the opening article on <unk> training , i was complaining a bit about the amount of information in the introductory lessons .
i had no idea what was coming .
lectures by three experts from the field ; <unk> <unk> for difficult figures ; and a seminar on how it works in practise .
and more is yet to come .
the closer we get to the final <unk> , the more information and practical tasks await .
the training takes place every saturday and sunday , but it is really packed with information .
this time , together with <unk> , the director , ( there is not a single man in the course ) we discussed how to <unk> a woman whose body is not in perfect symmetry .
a majority of women are not perfectly symmetrical .
one has a short neck , the other has a <unk> figure without proper <unk> , yet another is overweight .
a <unk> must know how to <unk> soften wide shoulders , make the neck look longer , or add the <unk> necessary .
we were given <unk> on how to <unk> the figure of women such as <unk> <unk> , i.e. with bigger <unk> and <unk> and narrow <unk> , and not to <unk> them too <unk> .
for example , if the difference between the <unk> and <unk> is such that the <unk> or <unk> do not fit , it is worth to have at least one piece custom - made .
you will definitely not regret the investment , as perfectly fitting clothes are <unk> .
in a custom - made <unk> , you will feel much better than in one that keeps shifting , rolling up , sticking out in your <unk> , etc.
<unk> figures , on the other hand , can wear clothes with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> .
given the abundance of such information and figure types , i am glad to have a whole week to sort it all out in my head .
still , i fear it is too much , with regard to the homework we were given .
each of the course participants was given a <unk> to create two <unk> for : day and night .
we must consider their current appearance , their fashion style , and figure type .
i am to <unk> <unk> <unk> whom you may know from the <unk> 's secret campaigns .
inside i rejoice , as she is so much easier to <unk> than , say , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who has recently gained about a <unk> ( please , understand i am <unk> ) , or the very young <unk> <unk> .
we must cut the clothes out of magazines or find them on the internet and print and <unk> process them .
<unk> , as the result is called , then expresses our personal style and attitude to graphic depiction .
it is important to think about the graphic part of <unk> .
a <unk> does not just <unk> physical people , but creates product pages in magazines ( based on specific instructions , for example , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , etc. ) .
this is what a <unk> and <unk> , mario <unk> , was telling us about .
but that was not until sunday .
a <unk> needs general knowledge
saturday 's <unk> , filled with information on figure types , was <unk> up by three guests from the field .
a <unk> , <unk> <unk> ; a fashion <unk> , <unk> <unk> ; and a fashion <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> reminded us that fashion is an illusion , and a <unk> should be able to use this fact .
a good <unk> can work with a single piece of clothing in different ways .
in this case , variability is key .
for example , a <unk> coat may be worn in the standard way , over <unk> and t - <unk> , as a coat ; but it may also be worn on naked body , with step - ins , as a <unk> .
another option is rolling up the sleeves or <unk> , and the entire look changes completely .
" play with it , " he emphasised .
however , i appreciated the following advice the most : " for your work , you need to know the rules perfectly . "
' then you can start breaking them , ' <unk> told us .
here i finally understood why we <unk> all the definitions and rules of what to combine with what and why , while in fashion magazines we often see something else .
not to mention fashion shows .
from <unk> , the <unk> , i learned that a <unk> must have more <unk> versions prepared than the number he is to take pictures of .
so , for a ten - page fashion story ( equals ten <unk> ) , i have to be ready to create at least fifteen of them .
now i also know that in the picture , a piece of clothing often looks and functions in combination with others completely different from reality .
we must therefore take that into consideration when creating an <unk> .
<unk> <unk> confirmed that image and style often are half the success .
just look at <unk> , who is no miraculous <unk> , yet her image and marketing turned her into a worldwide star .
the attitude towards <unk> services is still rather cold in the czech republic .
even famous people often consider it redundant ( believing it is sufficient to be good at something , and how they look at it comes second ) .
and if someone finally lets us create their <unk> , then we should expect them to give us different ( smaller ) size than what they really wear .
then , we are left to google and find out if the <unk> wrote something about a <unk> gaining / losing weight , etc.
on sunday , both <unk> and mario were stressing the fact that for a <unk> it is not enough to know about fashion and be able to create an <unk> .
our work chiefly consists of communicating with people we <unk> ; it is therefore important to be a good psychologist .
to be able to estimate people , not to <unk> , and stick to one 's opinion .
" if a manager asks you to go through her clothes and add some nice pieces , you cannot throw out her entire <unk> telling her how awful the clothes are . "
" find at least a few pieces you can praise , and recommend what to wear them with " mario says .
he also showed us what specifically a duty bag must contain .
that is the bag you <unk> around your <unk> to carry all the <unk> you need .
aside from the obvious things , such as <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , or safety <unk> , it should have a <unk> thread ( for the <unk> to use when taking pictures of products such as <unk> or <unk> ) , special <unk> - ons for holding the clothes in the back in case it is too large ( <unk> and similar things are forbidden as they damage the clothes ) , or a <unk> set .
to have some change from listening , and gain some practical experience , we learned how to properly <unk> <unk> <unk> .
even when taking photographs in a <unk> where the surface is even , the <unk> might get damaged - not to mention shooting outside .
and so we were sticking away .
you must not touch the shoes with the <unk> , to avoid any damage .
this requires real skill .
mario pleased me by praising my job .
the skills mentioned are really not my cup of <unk> .
this is just a <unk> of what we heard during the second weekend course session .
i am beginning to realise that to be a professional <unk> is no piece of <unk> , no matter what people say .
v need for speed : the run takes place across america .
review
an originally <unk> ride turned into a routine morning drive to work because of a series of completely superfluous and sloppy mistakes .
the ambitions were met to a certain point , but it does not matter since nobody obviously wanted to do any extra work .
before it was released , the new version <unk> the run created high expectations .
it promised to shift the old need for speed <unk> series in a new direction ; the demos made it look like a game that might stand up in the action <unk> <unk> .
we were curious to see the sections where the main character gets out of the car and runs .
typical for the <unk> series though , in the end many things are different from what we expected .
the game represents a possibly decent <unk> race , but the whole is burdened by several unnecessary mistakes <unk> in the series for a number of years .
this means they are not really mistakes , but the expression of an incomprehensible <unk> of the <unk> .
the adventure opens very well .
you are introduced into a story , where the main character , <unk> , decides to solve some personal issues by participating in an illegal race across america .
you get in the car on the west coast , in san <unk> , and your task is to be the first one to reach new york .
the idea brings several interesting features .
the route is divided into ten stages , <unk> into over fifty <unk> .
this means each race takes place on a different route , and given stages are set in varied and interesting environments .
one thus does not feel the game keeps offering the same things .
despite the <unk> being on the same level of previous parts of the series , some of the environments are very nice to look at .
still , it is nothing world - <unk> .
driving through the desert , <unk> countryside , or high in snow - covered mountains is <unk> very pleasant though .
in addition , the <unk> are , from time to time , <unk> by an <unk> feature .
for example , in the desert , you get into a <unk> , significantly decreasing the visibility .
on the other hand , in the mountains , you have to be careful not to get under an <unk> .
individual <unk> are ordered fairly well .
there are just a few types , but it is sufficient .
for a while , you try to overtake a number of competitors ( basically a regular race ) ; then you try to beat the time ( standard <unk> race ) ; or you are in a duel with a single rival .
on top of everything else you sometimes come across the police who make your efforts more difficult .
the parts outside the car are new .
they are just interactive <unk> , where most of the time <unk> is running away from someone and you need to help him by pressing the right <unk> at the right time .
nothing difficult .
it is a surprise though , that these parts are much less in number than you would expect ( just three to be precise ) .
it actually turns out to be good for the game , because this feature does not get to be <unk> ; within what was already said , it is one of the things that make the game more <unk> .
the driving model follows the footsteps of the previous parts .
this means that it is nothing special anymore , but it cannot be considered a negative .
if you are looking for a real - to - life <unk> , you will have to look elsewhere .
still , this driving model is fully suitable for the action style <unk> , even though we could find better at the competition .
so far , everything is just right .
however , after some time , problems come .
in contrast with the driving model , the collision model is not that good .
from a game of this type , one does not expect complicated <unk> and <unk> , but when you have no idea , before <unk> into any object , how your car will act , something is not right .
typically , when <unk> or passing cars tightly in common traffic , you sometimes lightly touch the other car . yet sometimes in nearly identical situation your car ends up in wild <unk> .
or , crashed completely .
this is not such a big deal due to the <unk> system , but is enough to <unk> the fun .
the <unk> are done so that if you <unk> or get far off the track , the game takes you back to the last interrupted point .
nevertheless , there are only five <unk> available per each race .
if you use them up , you have to start the race from the beginning .
this makes it an aid in case something does not work out , but you cannot rely on it completely .
sometimes the <unk> are not enough and you need to learn a given section of the race by heart .
a significant shortcoming of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places .
for example , some turns have to be driven through in a specific way , otherwise you simply do not fit in .
at other times you meet civilian cars at a given place in the very same configuration , no matter if you come first , fifth , five seconds earlier , or one minute later .
this is especially annoying in situations where you can see how your rival <unk> through the two cars coming in the opposite direction so easily , while when you get there , the cars are already <unk> so that you have to either drive around or slow down .
it makes no difference when you get to them ; everything is set so that the situation always occurs just in front of your nose .
the competitors have other advantages , too .
while playing the game , you find several places , where , regardless of time , the same competitor <unk> you at the very same spot .
this is most obvious at the end of the game , on a long bridge , where you are driving in the opposite direction .
obviously , your rival has to get in front of you no matter what .
the thing is that when he is driving in front of you , he makes your vision worse , which causes you to <unk> the car a few times in the section .
one can understand the attempt at making the game more interesting and <unk> - filled , but it is so obvious it gets annoying quickly .
it 's a pity , because despite the simple driving model , the game is <unk> and sometimes even so full of action you do not have time to pay attention to what is happening around you .
it is not important whether the reason you do not get bored is the concept with fifty unique <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , or something else .
the idea of changing cars during <unk> is unusual .
you have to watch out for gas stations along the way , as that is where you car may change despite the fact that in most of the cases the one you have is fully sufficient .
cars are divided into three categories .
sports cars are suitable for cities ; strong american cars for straight <unk> sections ; and <unk> <unk> cars for technical driving , such as along crooked mountain <unk> .
the key story mode is closely connected with the challenge mode ; these are the <unk> in individual locations you know from the story .
here , you gain both <unk> and experience points for your profile , common for both challenges and the story .
various features unlock <unk> getting a higher driver level : starting with cars and ending with profile <unk> .
again , the profile is interconnected with an on - line <unk> function , which , among other things , <unk> the results you have reached with those of other players , and ensures community functions .
yet another <unk> difficult to understand ; is the situation from the last race in the story .
you and your car get into a <unk> tunnel ( let 's say you do ) , where you speed down the <unk> in the <unk> ( let 's say you do ) .
your <unk> shows numbers from 000 to 000 km / h ( let 's say it does ) , when suddenly , a <unk> train comes running down from behind you , turning your car into a pile of scrap metal .
for several days , our editorial staff kept discussing whether when designing the game no one thought for a moment or whether its authors really think we are such <unk> .
the technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary ; but the overall visual impression is mostly pleasant , sometimes even great .
it is a pity though , that in some dramatic moments , the recording , in some cases rather tragically , <unk> .
this especially concerns accidents with large number of participants , where <unk> <unk> would not help you much anyway .
the sound is all right ; the <unk> is a matter of taste .
in order to please the widest possible young audience , the <unk> is ' <unk> in from all quarters ' ; but there probably will not be many people buying the game because of its music .
overall impression of need for speed : the run is quite confused .
if the game avoided those clearly redundant mistakes , we could sincerely say that the run is the best part of <unk> for the past several years .
however , the game feels unfinished .
it surely is a nice <unk> , but prepare to be blinded by the mistakes with the strength of airport <unk> .

eu <unk> <unk> :
czechs have the reputation of being negative and euro - sceptical
" lisbon treaty caused significant imbalance between individual institutions . "
" i did not expect it to be such a tough war . "
" it will take five or six years before the situation becomes somewhat stable , calm , and before all players get used to their new roles , " eu <unk> <unk> <unk> opened her <unk> at the law department sharply .
she proved how true she is to her " clearly and openly about europe " motto in the very first part of her <unk> , where she described individual eu organs and the relationships between them in such a clear and intelligible , way that many <unk> from the uk law <unk> could be <unk> .
moreover , <unk> praised the work of new long - term president of the european council , <unk> van <unk> :
" at first , critics said he was plain , a grey office <unk> who cannot fulfil any roles ; i have to say everyone was amazed at how wonderfully he acquitted his role . "
" he is a person who can listen to all twenty - seven member states , communicate with them perfectly , and who has a clear vision of where the eu should be headed . "
she explained her new position of foreign affairs and security policy representative as a reply to a question : " who is the european union ? which phone number should i call ? " ; i.e. as an important step to unification and better clarity of union 's policy towards countries such as china or india .
no one wants to ban our cheese <unk>
<unk> further focused on the agenda crucial for the eu in the past , present , and near future .
she described czech presidency from the year before last as a success .
czechs were dealing with the coming financial crisis ; they solved the as crisis ; and organised the east partnership summit .
she said the fall of the government at the time was a great negative causing significant damage to the czech republic .
currently , czech representatives in the eu has been very busy .
as the <unk> said , both the presidency and the following financial crisis caused an ongoing <unk> .
in addition , a new seven - year eu budget needs to be passed , which is very complicated due to the current crisis .
whether the budget will be slim and <unk> ; which fields will be given preference ; which countries will be supported more and which less ; all of that is on the coming agenda .
the <unk> reminded the key slogans she took to brussels : " about europe , clearly . "
" i really do not like all the abbreviations , foreign words , and jargon no one understands .
how are citizens supposed to understand that in brussels , people are not trying to come up with crooked or round <unk> , different size <unk> , or that someone wants to ban our cheese <unk> . '
she also wants to use the eu environment better , and get more czechs into european institutions .
<unk> europe is coming
the <unk> says czechs are said to be euro - sceptics ; as well as people noticing the negative rather than the positive sides of things .
she wishes more czech representatives were involved in european institutions .
she thinks numerous factors are to blame : for example , the <unk> of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters ; together with low support from the czech side .
along with the success of czech presidency , she highlighted the power and cooperation of the <unk> group .
" believe me that when i meet someone from poland and hungary , and a slovak is coming to join us , the frenchman next to me says : " <unk> , what 's that gathering about , is that the <unk> group again ? ' and he is not happy about it in the slightest . '
in the union 's future , <unk> expects mainly new strict rules for the budget policy of member states .
rather than a new european federation , she finds the concept of two - speed , if not multi - speed europe , very realistic .
" we have both countries inside and outside the eurozone . "
" we have schengen area , and we already have an institute of reinforced cooperation . "
" for the first time it was said that the countries who want are to cooperate , while those who are not willing can stand off . "
" the number of such institutes will be growing ; it will be a highly two - speed europe , " <unk> expects .
in this regard , she appreciated the roles of both the czech republic and <unk> van <unk> in pushing forward the rule based on which , all topics influencing the entire eu should be negotiated by all member states , and not just those belonging into the eurozone .
brand story :
the <unk> <unk> starts the second century of its existence
should someone search for the word that would best express the <unk> strategy , the closest one would probably be " long - term . "
to the wide public , <unk> is a symbol of technological revolution ; the company is seen as a highly temporary one , yet it was founded over a hundred years ago .
the company 's <unk> goes back to its first boss , a visionary , <unk> <unk> watson <unk>
he believed in his motto saying that numerous world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think .
his motto : ' think ! ' thus become an <unk> around which the life of the future giant would <unk> ( as well as the name of its internal magazine that <unk> started to publish in 0000 ) .
moreover , it was the foundation of company culture watson was building carefully .
" for us in <unk> , long - term thinking means continuous movement towards the future .
<unk> survived and flourished for a hundred years , because it remained true to its original values , while it was not afraid to change everything around itself .
during our first century , this allowed us to transform the technology , business , and the company .
in the second century , we hope to be able to achieve even more , " says current company director , <unk> <unk> <unk> , on the occasion of the anniversary .
sophisticated system
in the 0000s , watson approached employee care similarly to <unk> in the czech republic - people from <unk> were among the first american employees to have a paid holiday , insurance from their employer , an <unk> uniform , and a sophisticated system of bonuses for the best <unk> and businessmen .
just as sophisticated is <unk> 's long - term relationship with customers .
from the very beginning , the company was brilliant in exploiting talented people . it was one of the first world companies to abolish all discrimination , which rendered it with great selection .
consistent with the anti - discrimination strategy is the current plan expecting a woman , <unk> <unk> , to take over after <unk> next year .
she has been working in <unk> for thirty years ; she is currently a director of sales , marketing , and strategy .
in the last few years , <unk> has been organising jams , on - line <unk> sessions , from which many future strategies and innovations arise .
it is no surprise that the ideas are plentiful - the company employs nearly half a million people .
institution with a good reputation
company 's strong business position is ensured by its strong internal and external image .
" from the beginning , the concept of <unk> was that of an institution rather than a technology company , ' a <unk> business school professor and author of a book about <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , told the economist .
" <unk> is not a technology firm ; it is a company that helps to solve business problems using technology , " george colony of <unk> research consultation company adds .
as the company itself says , there is a difference between entering a market and creating it .
during the hundred years , <unk> , or the " big blue , " as it is called in the us because of its logo , has grown into one of the largest companies in the world .
it seems to be the most universal technology company - developing hardware and software ; infrastructure ; <unk> ; and consultation services within a range from servers to nanotechnologies .
it holds the most patents of all american technology companies ; five of its employees were awarded the nobel price .
its inventions include , for example , the cash point , pay card , financial <unk> , bar code , and <unk> <unk> .
with about 000 billion dollars , based on market <unk> , <unk> has become the second largest technology company ( apple being number one ) this year , <unk> microsoft for the first time since 0000 .
view ahead
not all of its products fitted the taste of both the customers and period . for example , <unk> failed with its own operating system <unk> / 0 ; <unk> on - line services ; and <unk> <unk> computers .
" if your business is defined by movement forward , you cannot be emotionally attached to the past , ' says <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that is why <unk> easily builds its foundations on many platforms - if they do not work , it leaves them .
this is how it differs from , for example , its competitor , microsoft , which basically stands and falls on <unk> , its operating system .
perspective technology
<unk> 's revenues chiefly consist of services , about one fifth for each comes from software and hardware .
while in 0000 , with over a half share , it was the strongest hardware representative .
since 0000 , <unk> has sold low profitable assets worth 00 billion dollars . during the same time , it has invested 00 billion dollars into purchasing of perspective technologies .
it has continued the investments even after 0000 , when the modern economic crisis first hit the world .
<unk> follows the legacy of its first director , <unk> <unk> watson , who increased the amount of investments during the great <unk> .
so far , <unk> seems to be getting through the current crisis without any harm .
since the beginning of 0000 , the price of <unk> 's shares has grown by remarkable 000 per cent ; company 's net earnings have been growing continuously .
<unk> 's company motto is to change everything , except for its values .
we may therefore expect that even if another crisis comes , this flexible giant will manage .
<unk> history : from cheese <unk> to space travel
<unk> ( international business machines ) was founded in new york , a hundred years ago . its original name " <unk> <unk> recording corporation " was quite complicated .
it took the name of <unk> in 0000 . originally , this was a brand used for company 's branches in canada and south america .
foundations for the later <unk> were laid by a merger of four companies , the history of which goes back to the 0000s .
they owned technologies such as the <unk> " time clock , " i.e. a clock recording the time when employees arrive and leave work .
the architect of the new company was a <unk> , charles <unk> <unk> , who , until 0000 , also presided over the company 's board of trustees .
<unk> <unk> a director of a competing company , <unk> <unk> watson , to help him with company management .
the leader then put the <unk> 's founder in the <unk> - watson 's ideas remain the base for <unk> company culture and identity .
watson led the company until 0000 .
<unk> , as its name suggests , started by producing and selling various business machines - from meat and cheese <unk> to cash registers .
during the first four years of watson 's leadership , the revenue doubled to nine million dollars , and company 's vast expansion into all continents commenced .
watson became so essential for the company , that after nearly forty years , his position in the director 's chair was taken by his son , <unk> watson <unk> .
under his leadership , <unk> started to develop artificial intelligence and created the first programming language .
in 0000s , both people and computers from <unk> helped nasa control space flights - to mercury , <unk> , and in 0000 , man 's flight to the moon .
meanwhile , in 0000 , <unk> developed the first computer family - the <unk> line system / 000 .
the classic <unk> that defined the computer standards of the period , called <unk> 0000 , came to the market in 0000 .
twenty years later , <unk> sold computer production to a chinese company , <unk> , while buying the consultant division of <unk> , and thus commenced its full focus on consulting and high added value services .
in the past three years , <unk> has been highly successful with its smarter planet concept .
its goal is both smart exploitation of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned for and improving the situation in traffic or town management .
for commerce , <unk> has recently introduced a smarter commerce platform that helps businessmen control the whole commerce cycle .
<unk> 's history is strong even in our country .
in former czechoslovakia , as the first country in both central and eastern europe , <unk> founded its branch in 0000 .
today , <unk> <unk> also runs a strategic outsourcing centre in <unk> .
the headquarters for both central and eastern europe <unk> in prague , where there also is a world level research team focusing on voice recognition .
<unk> about her <unk> husband :
<unk> , keep the fool , i do n't want him anymore !
<unk> <unk> ( 00 ) said it is over !
after her husband , <unk> <unk> ( 00 ) , became both the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> ( 00 ) , <unk> still hoped he would wake up and come back home .
however , she does not want to wait any longer , and set clear rules for her future life .
" <unk> may return home , but no longer as my partner , " <unk> explained .
when <unk> <unk> provided shelter for <unk> in her house in summer , she probably had not the slightest idea of what was going to happen to her marriage .
even though she had <unk> move out of <unk> 00 days later , <unk> would not leave the <unk> .
moreover , he publically admitted he loved her .
after some time , <unk> resigned , <unk> to accept her husband 's affair ; and now she gave him her final <unk> .
<unk> does not care who his wife <unk> with
even if one day <unk> and <unk> would split up , his wife will not welcome him with open arms .
" he is the biological father to my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house , no one will chase him out . "
" however , he will complete his days not as my beloved , lost and found old fool , but as a person i have certain <unk> to , " <unk> said , adding she had already disengaged herself from her husband and only insists on mutual <unk> .
so far , <unk> does not mind that his wife closed the <unk> gate on him .
" i respect my wife 's decision . "
" i will be with <unk> , and i do n't mean to change that . "
" my wife decided for marriage on paper , and i respect it . "
" our company still operates ; i am in charge of <unk> , <unk> , the house , and shopping . "
" <unk> and i communicate in a completely normal way , only we do not share our bed anymore , " <unk> said for <unk> .
he claims that if <unk> found a new love , he would not stand in her way .
" we do n't <unk> together , and i do n't care where she goes , with whom , and if she has a <unk> .
i know it 's my fault , i fell in love with <unk> , and i accept full responsibility , " <unk> concluded .
the worst feminine habits : do they concern you ?
when you ask men to name some typical bad habits women have , they usually come up with all of them in an instant .
dear ladies , do you recognise yourself in the lines to follow , describing several women 's habits that make the men see red ?
shopping
does your other half complain you are addicted to shopping ?
do you need to buy at least one piece of clothing a week ?
do you like shopping , in mass sales ?
if so , then your shopping may be seen as bad habit .
some women recognise they should somewhat control their passion for shopping .
still , who of you could resist walking through clothes shops looking for well fitting clothes and then trying them all ( ideally , in various colour versions ) in the changing rooms ?
shopping may be a <unk> for a majority of women , but for men , it may become absolute hell .
just remember how many times you have told your other half to wait for you outside ...
permanent dissatisfaction
" am i too fat ? "
" i need to lose at least five <unk> - should i start doing some exercise ? "
" are you still attracted to me ? "
do you find these sentences familiar ?
you do ?
then , you belong to the group of women <unk> by their appearance .
not that you should stop looking after yourself , but many men are literary <unk> to their partners " constant complaints about their looks .
the stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of such complaints , the more annoying women are .
order and <unk> first
it is like a never ending story .
cleaning the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the floors , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> - at least twice a week .
do you blame your partner for stepping onto the clean <unk> in dirty shoes ; your children for <unk> up a clean sink and leaving <unk> over the glass <unk> in the living room that was so difficult to clean ?
in case you suffer from this " deviation , " try to realise that no extremes are good ; and that within your family , order and <unk> should not go first .
this <unk> desire for <unk> may threaten your relationships , as well as the entire family .
<unk> about
" throw the <unk> into the bin . "
" do you plan to wear the dirty <unk> tomorrow ? "
" wet <unk> do not belong on the floor . "
if you boss your partner around several times a day , he may find it very annoying .
naturally , you mean well , you just want everything to be perfect .
maybe , if men realised that , women would not have to boss them around so much ...
<unk>
some women love <unk> , offending , and <unk> against others .
women are focused on relationships , which is why they like to discuss who , where , who with , how , and why .
every now and then , probably each of us releases a <unk> here or there .
let 's be frank , this is probably the nature all women .
however , there are tougher <unk> , women who enjoy frequent <unk> and despise everyone . they are , especially within a female work team , very dangerous for their surroundings .
<unk> of <unk> and <unk> helped <unk> 's victory
during monday 's <unk> match , hockey forward , <unk> <unk> 's two <unk> helped <unk> 's victory 0:0 on <unk> 's ice . again , he leads the productivity of czech players in the game .
in both cases , claude <unk> , used the experience of a thirty - nine year old star ; he added an extra pass and was announced best player of the match .
two <unk> in the match also <unk> to <unk> 's team - <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
after the match , <unk> told the overseas journalists he had predicted a great evening for <unk> .
" i told him before the match he would score a <unk> - trick . "
" i felt it . "
" you sometimes feel such things , " explained <unk> , after whose action <unk> <unk> a goal on the first <unk> " shot .
a little bit later , second score for the team bore czech traces too .
the <unk> hurricanes ' <unk> won the <unk> and presented it to maxim <unk> , who <unk> between the circles .
a second before the first break , a home player , patrick <unk> , <unk> the lead in a power - play , but the beginning of the second part was led by <unk> again .
specifically by <unk> .
after assist with <unk> , he <unk> the third goal ; consequently , his shot was touched into a fourth goal by <unk> <unk> .
" i love playing with him . "
" i do n't ; want to say he 's the best league player , but he 's definitely among the best three , " said <unk> , <unk> his <unk> .
" i never thought that at the end of my career i would play with a hockey player like him . "
" it makes me happy . "
" i want to assist him . "
" all those years in <unk> , my team - mates tried to assist me , and now its reversing , " <unk> added .
<unk> made the match more dramatic with <unk> <unk> and <unk> 's goal from a penalty shot , making it a single goal difference .
further complications were avoided by <unk> read who increased the difference to two points .
" <unk> did great in our zone . "
" he <unk> out the <unk> , i gained speed , and read went on to the more distant <unk> . "
" i aimed at him , and i <unk> glad it worked , " <unk> described his view of the last goal of the match .
its victory moved <unk> onto the top of the eastern conference .
czech montreal <unk> , <unk> <unk> , did not finish the match with <unk> ; he left in the second period due to an upper body injury .
along with the experienced back , the <unk> lost their two - goal lead and lost 0:0 after a penalty <unk> - out .
tomáš <unk> failed to score on one of their <unk> .
more than lost points , the home <unk> was sorry for high sick rate in the back , as the match was finished with just five defenders .
" the situation is bad . "
" we finished the match with just one experienced player , the rest were young men . "
" however , there is nothing we can do about that , we just have to face it , " jacques martin said .
" substitution by substitution , it was overwhelming and we could n't resist . "
" we should have made the game simpler , moving the <unk> out of our zone . "
" that was our weakness , " a defender , <unk> <unk> <unk> added .
with thirty interventions , czech <unk> , <unk> <unk> , helped <unk> 's 0:0 victory over <unk> <unk> .
jets " goals , which interrupted a five - match series of losses , were shared by five different <unk> .
development of trip prices since 0000
until 0000 , only five state travel agencies were allowed in the former czechoslovakia : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
as travelling to the west was strictly limited , travel agencies of the time mostly sold <unk> to the socialist block countries .
for their holiday , czech tourists thus went to the sea to the german democratic republic ; soviet union ( <unk> , <unk> near the black sea ) ; bulgaria ; romania ( both to the black sea ) ; and hungary ( <unk> ) .
the only exception was the period from 0000 to 0000 , when we had the opportunity to travel to yugoslavia . nevertheless , the <unk> regime turned west , which caused significant limitations to trips to yugoslavia for czech tourists .
a great paradox of the <unk> period was that citizens of the socialist block ( i.e. <unk> too ) were not allowed free individual travel within the socialist countries .
if a czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel , as an individual , to , for example , the soviet union or poland , an invitation letter from the country was necessary ; otherwise , individual travel was impossible .
at the time , travel agencies would offer some trips to the west , but one either had to stand in a line overnight , with a <unk> bag or have some " good friends " in the agency .
still , that was not all .
a foreign currency assurance was essential for <unk> to the west . it was not granted to politically unreliable people , who were not allowed to travel at all .
<unk> currency was not freely <unk> ; without the currency assurance , it was not possible to obtain financial means ( western currency ) for travelling west .
most often , czechs spent their holiday at home , which resulted in great number of <unk> and summer houses , a habit that survives until now .
since 0000 , czech tourism thus experienced a real revolution .
while until 0000 , a holiday in the <unk> or bulgaria was the <unk> of our <unk> , last year , czechs spent 0.0 million holidays in countries all over the world .
a great paradox we do not realise anymore is that until 0000 , we could not freely visit the currently most popular croatia , as it was part of former yugoslavia .
right at the beginning of 0000 , visa requirements for neighbouring west european countries were cancelled . this started a huge wave of short - term visits of chiefly vienna and germany .
<unk> could not get enough of travelling to the west . everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment .
for example , in paris , czech <unk> <unk> in parks in <unk> , because their income at the time was not enough to pay for a hotel or a pension .
a typical feature of czech tourism then was bringing their own food ( <unk> , salami , etc. ) to save money .
another important moment was the introduction of freely <unk> czech crown . after decades , our tourists thus finally able to freely buy western <unk> .
our living standards and average income were growing , which , around 0000 , resulted in another important moment .
since 0000 , increased demand allowed travel agencies to prepare regular trips by charter airlines . compared to the past , air trips thus became unbelievably cheap due to the ability to order quantity <unk> .
by the end of 0000s , czechs did not need visa for visiting nearly all developed world countries , except for the usa . this made our travelling even easier .
the next significant event in the history of after revolution travelling came in 0000 . high demand resulted in the historically first direct charter flight from the czech republic to an <unk> country , thailand .
since then , direct charter flights take czech tourists to warm <unk> countries . this winter , flights from the czech republic will reach twelve <unk> <unk> .
currently about 000 thousand czechs visit <unk> countries every year !
yet another important event of this period , symbolising our development after the revolution , came in 0000 .
on november 00 , 0000 , the usa removed visa requirements for czech tourists . our country has thus permanently joined the world 's most developed countries .
for the first time in history , in 0000 czechs spent more than a half of their holidays abroad ( 00.0 % ) ; and for the first time in history , they spent over 00 thousand crowns per person per holiday abroad , including their costs at the destination .
general meeting should find a president , <unk> threat returns
for nearly five months , czech football has had no president . there exists a risk that ivan <unk> 's successor , the head of czech republic 's football association ( <unk> ) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting , which is to take place in <unk> on thursday .
there is still no agreement as to which election rules to follow .
without it , voting for the three candidates will not start .
<unk> <unk> , miroslav <unk> , and tomáš <unk> are eager to lead czech football .
<unk> resigned from his function in june . when leaving , he called to his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future .
however , <unk> 's era sees football back in <unk> between both association chambers , unable to agree on a common candidate .
this was fully shown on september 00 , when a new president was to be chosen .
general meeting delegates wasted their trip to the national house in prague , <unk> , as the negotiations remained blocked , not just regarding the election method .
no agreement was reached as to who is entitled to vote at the general meeting - whether the statutory representatives only , or also officials given power of <unk> .
this single point has been partially settled since , thanks to a recommendation of the institute of state and law , according to which representation based on power of <unk> is not possible .
arguments concerning the election rules continue , though .
the executive board has not been of much help either , though at its meetings , both regular and extraordinary , it is mostly <unk> by this issue .
the view of election options has changed several times , but the key point remains the same .
the question is : how to proceed in the <unk> round to avoid <unk> ?
" the argument is based on whether to follow the by - laws or to find another model , " says one of the three <unk> vice - presidents , <unk> <unk> , who represents professional football in the association 's management .
based on the model given by the by - laws , the winner of the <unk> round is a candidate with higher percentage support from the chamber he is the candidate for .
<unk> is said to accept a compromise to have a candidate with the highest percentage of total votes from both chambers win the election .
the czech part stresses a condition that in the percentage total , the winner must gain at least two - third <unk> .
" however , the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning ; that would completely deny the two - chamber concept , " <unk> agrees with <unk> 's arguments . he says it would be best not to bend the rules and vote according to the existing regulations .
somewhat surprisingly tomáš <unk> agrees with his opinion even if it is estimated that the election rules defined by the by - laws fits <unk> best of the candidates .
' i wish the elections follow the by - laws to the maximum . '
" i want to avoid all kinds of representative nonsense , as at the previous general meeting , " says the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , who is a candidate for the first time ; and in his statements he chiefly stood against <unk> .
<unk> remains an <unk> .
he believes the new president will be known in <unk> ; he also hopes that in the future , the candidates will cooperate constructively .
" all passionate <unk> will calm down with today 's prospective advance of the national team into the european <unk> . "
" football will be back on the happy wave , people will be more willing to cooperate , " a <unk> <unk> says . of the three candidates , he has the most experience with football management on both professional and regional levels .
<unk> is more reserved .
" i hope for an agreement , but the situation is very <unk> . "
" it is not between people from bohemia and <unk> , but there are attempts at <unk> adjustment of regulations . "
" that may cause another <unk> of the general meeting . "
" i hope the common sense wins , " <unk> said .
there is not much time left for an agreement between the parties .
some negotiations are said to have taken place directly in montenegro ; but who knows if the football <unk> will be complete before the match .
an extra flight that was to take , among others , the vice presidents <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> did not leave prague in the morning due to a technical failure . an alternative was sought for in order to transport part of the executive board to the scene of the <unk> <unk> .
finally , a meeting at ministry level , said to happen on wednesday , may decide .
minister of education , youth , and sports , <unk> <unk> , would like to force the split parties inside the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement .
a lot is in the game : government grants ; football trustworthiness ; and the planned <unk> general meeting dealing with new direction of czech sports following <unk> 's financial problems .
<unk> enters the presidential fight as he cannot see a suitable candidate
if , before the extraordinary general meeting , the head of <unk> football players , tomáš <unk> , saw a strong candidate , who would meet all of his expectations of a new football association of the czech republic ( <unk> ) president , he would not even apply for the top function .
" if there was a good quality candidate , i <unk> fight for him and not participate in the fight . "
" but no such person has currently been found , " <unk> said to <unk> .
<unk> 's motivation to join the fight with miroslav <unk> and <unk> <unk> is to try to prevent <unk> , reportedly the favourite of the elections , from entering the top of the <unk> .
moreover , <unk> emphasizes that should he win , he would only remain the president until 0000 , when a regular general meeting is scheduled .
in the future , he would like to see the position given to an experienced top manager , not excessively connected to football life .
" i <unk> spoken to some people that could be considered . "
" i was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at this point , they do n't even want to identify themselves with czech football . "
" i <unk> like to change this opinion , " he said .
at the moment , <unk> 's strongest disagreement with <unk> is based on the latter 's connection to roman <unk> , president of <unk> 's regional football association . <unk> is a man of controversial reputation , who is , behind the scenes , known as powerful lobbyist , capable of influencing the votes of general meeting delegates .
<unk> therefore finds it unacceptable for <unk> to become the president .
" if he wins , current situation will be preserved and nothing in football would move forward . "
" combined with support from <unk> , a capable <unk> , this would be even more harmful for the football , " <unk> said .
he is <unk> at the fact that some years ago , <unk> 's name was recorded during phone <unk> in a corruption affair investigation ; <unk> came out without a sentence .
" i do n't know what prestige <unk> 's victory would bring to football . "
" and how would we look in the eyes uefa and fifa , " <unk> said . he is now more <unk> from his former statement saying he would " sell the <unk> club if <unk> became president . "
in case <unk> wins on thursday , he could imagine cooperation with <unk> in the future .
this opinion is shared by another candidate , <unk> , whom <unk> supported before the september general meeting that ended as a fiasco .
" he ( <unk> ) would be the first one i <unk> go to . "
' he is very capable . '
" i can see him as the head of the representation . "
' but he cannot manage the association . '
" i do n't poke my nose in what i do n't understand either , ' said <unk> , who gained a lot of attention in september , when he supported the removal of board of <unk> , led by <unk> <unk> , replaced by <unk> <unk> .
<unk> claims he would dare to manage the association .
he refers to his skills from management of private companies ; since last summer , he has been managing the <unk> team that , with his support , celebrated its first league triumph in may .
" i have the strength to make the football environment change , to support its improvement . "
" to limit the influence of some interest groups that tend to influence the <unk> and appeal board , leading to <unk> situations , " <unk> said . he does not hide his <unk> for , e.g. <unk> 's director , daniel <unk> .
one of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between <unk> and the czech olympic committee , with whose support he would lobby at the political top to get more money for sports from the lottery tax .
" that 's one of the key things the new president should attend to . "
" if taxes are imposed on gambling , as the political parties declare , i understand their arguments , but they must clearly say where the money will go , " he said .
<unk> does not consider his connection with the <unk> club a burden , though he claims that an <unk> president should be a non - party one .
<unk> is connected to <unk> , and <unk> to prague <unk> .
" it 's not ideal . "
" yet , i do n't see a point in transferring my shares in the <unk> club hypocritically to someone else , while coming back there in six months , " <unk> says .
<unk> promised new <unk> regulations that would avoid election <unk>
two days before the general meeting of the football association , one of the presidential candidates , miroslav <unk> , promised that if he is elected , he would strive for new <unk> regulations to avoid future disputes over the election rules .
before the thursday negotiations in <unk> , a <unk> <unk> remains an <unk> and believes that the pre - election fight would be significantly suppressed by today 's prospective success of our football representation .
prior to the failed election in september , <unk> promised that if he was to win , he would focus on both the representation and gaining of financial means .
he decided to participate in the elections before the last general meeting at the last moment . a two - month delay thus could have been useful for him to defend his ideas concerning football management in wider context .
" people at all levels have been in football for long , and they expect the president to be known on thursday . "
" they feel it 's high time someone leads the association , " claims the man chiefly connected with the <unk> club ; but he spent many years in <unk> and the association 's executive board .
this gives him the reason to believe he is experienced enough to manage czech football .
he believes current problems with elections are caused by the euphoria there was in the time of ivan <unk> 's reign .
" unfortunately , regulations that were not as perfect as we all thought were passed at the general meeting in june . "
" if various representations were not accepted , we would have had a president since september , " <unk> said .
he approached the rewriting of the key document of the civil association as a <unk> for the delegates .
" if i become president , i will take it as my personal task , and i <unk> willing to take personal responsibility in case the attempt fails . "
" it is a fundamental issue we cannot exist without , " <unk> claims .
other than that , he says he does not try to define himself against the <unk> .
in the past , he has already announced he can imagine his cooperation with <unk> <unk> , whom he recognises for his legal education ; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice president .
for a long time , he did not attack tomáš <unk> , who has constantly criticised <unk> .
" he 's been in football for over a year , and gained some success . "
" however , his attacks were not decent , and many people were caught by surprise by the method of his election campaign . "
" this is too , is why some of them now doubt his true character , " <unk> said about his rival . <unk> himself claims to be true to the <unk> he announced in september .
he sees his strongest weapon in knowledge of football , from the lowest competitions to representation .
the representation should be the shopping window of football .
" <unk> would also try to end all affairs , starting from the <unk> case or the aftermath of last year 's corruption scandal . "
" right after that , i would focus on negotiations with both private and state sectors , to ensure enough money for the whole football , " the forty - six year old candidate told <unk> two months ago .
he then promised that his arrival to the head of the football would not mean any personnel <unk> .
" i <unk> need to learn about the job <unk> of individual employees . " that was his message for <unk> , where the long period of <unk> causes understandable <unk> .
despite current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the general meeting planned , he believes that on thursday , the delegates will not come to <unk> in vain .
" if the only questionable point is how to perform the elections in the third round that is something we can get over . "
" football needs trustworthiness it can only gain by finally having its leader , " says <unk> , who , two days before the crucial day of his career of a <unk> , remains an <unk> .
<unk> promises that under him , the <unk> will start working hard
if , on thursday 's general meeting , <unk> <unk> , the existing vice president , is to become the president of czech football association , many people in the association would reportedly not be pleased .
<unk> promises that if he is elected , hard work will come .
he wants to establish system changes and make members of the executive board responsible for individual football areas .
he also promised to solve the <unk> case ; improve relations with both uefa and fifa ; bring more money to football ; and continue the work of the previous president , ivan <unk> .
" as president , i <unk> like to focus on football as a whole . "
" from international contacts with uefa and fifa , to representation , professional football , and performance football for the youth . "
" by this , i do n't mean i <unk> do everything on my own , " <unk> said in his interview for <unk> .
" i <unk> a team player , and i want to distribute the competences within the executive board so that each member focuses on a certain area . "
' i 'll distribute tasks strictly so that in each of these segments , football makes big steps forward . "
" that would probably not please many people , as it would mean hard work , not just <unk> of the work of others , " he added .
critical atmosphere in football movement supposedly made him doubt his candidature .
" i <unk> known to work 00 hours a day . "
" but i need to know if it has any sense ; and that i wo n't be surrounded by people throwing sticks under my feet and question my every move , " he explained his hesitation .
" however , many people told me i must n't give up , otherwise others would follow . "
" that 's a trust i ca n't just throw away , " he said .
moreover , he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with <unk> .
" a great amount of work was done in those two years , and i do n't want to throw it all away . "
" processes have been started that may bear fruit in a few years , and i do n't want someone else to stop them , " he said , in fear that if the other candidate , miroslav <unk> , is elected , situation f the association might return to the period before <unk> .
" i believe in systematic approach , which is something i do n't think <unk> <unk> is competent of . "
" he is chiefly surrounded by people who would do football so that it would only be for the chosen ones . "
" i can be blamed for many things , but certainly not for being subjective . "
" i try to be objective . "
" i want to make football for everyone , because then everyone has a good time , not just the chosen few , " <unk> said .
furthermore , he <unk> the allegations he would only be a czech president .
" though some people try to claim the opposite , i plan to do the maximum for <unk> . "
" for example , it is high time to consider about splitting the second league into czech and <unk> parts , winners of which would continue into the first league . "
" this would prevent the current situation , where there are just three <unk> units in the league , which is a problem concerning young players in <unk> , " <unk> said .
as the presidential fight has been joined by <unk> club manager , tomáš <unk> , <unk> does not dare to estimate his chances to win .
" nevertheless , i can still feel a strong support in the czech chamber that elected me its vice president , and can see i have achieved some clear successes , " <unk> said . among his successes , he includes the saving of dozens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts , negotiating tv contracts , and negotiations about the lottery law .
on the other hand , he considers the fact that the association does not stick together partially as his own fault .
while claiming that <unk> has been ' <unk> from returning trustworthiness to czech football ' , he considers the other rival , <unk> , a strong candidate that has things to offer .
" no one can doubt that he did a great job in <unk> this year . "
" if he is elected , i hope he would continue in the things ivan <unk> started , without significant personnel changes in the committees . "
" he would n't want to <unk> things for his own benefit , " <unk> said about his rival .
europe 's most beautiful <unk>
leap into the water
by julia <unk>
<unk> <unk> with universal fibre <unk> and status <unk> in budapest . travellers can experience europe 's incredible water - and relax tired limbs in a <unk> after a city tour or a <unk> .
one book can tell you where the water is at its best .
there was one thing <unk> <unk> could not do without on research trips over the last one and a half years : her <unk> <unk> .
lying back on the water , she has looked up at <unk> designed <unk> , has <unk> towards <unk> <unk> awaiting her at the edge of the pool and has <unk> at meticulously restored art <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she rushed to add any pool she liked to her <unk> - with essential details on the construction and the history of the building .
the architectural <unk> <unk> looked at more than 000 <unk> <unk> - and has now compiled here experiences in her recently published book <unk> ( the <unk> of <unk> ) , covering everything from public <unk> baths in munich to historical <unk> <unk> in the black forest and " <unk> concrete buildings " in <unk> .
her " journey to the most unusual baths in central europe " took here through 00 countries . besides germany , austria and switzerland , she visited baths in italy , france , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , hungary , romania and poland - and one city each in luxembourg , serbia and croatia .
the 00 - year - old is a real <unk> culture <unk> .
she has very little enthusiasm for sport , says <unk> - but in the water , it 's a different matter .
the only <unk> is that <unk> of <unk> have to cope with blue <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> while <unk> can breathe in the <unk> <unk> of spruce forests or listen to the bright <unk> of birds in the park .
" one day , i asked myself why <unk> baths always have to be so ugly , " says vienna - based <unk> .
" so i started collecting beautiful baths . "
water surface doubles architecture
<unk> in the <unk> pool and <unk> <unk> <unk> - the <unk> factor in baths is so great because all the senses are stimulated , according to <unk> .
and <unk> baths can be a real treat for the eyes if the <unk> have gone to the trouble . " you have the surface of the water in <unk> instead of a floor . "
" the surface is very transparent , but also reflects the <unk> of the entire building . "
everything is mirrored <unk> : high ceilings , colourful <unk> and <unk> boards .
the illustrated <unk> the <unk> of <unk> provides valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of historic pleasure and health <unk> over 000 pages - and makes you want to leap into the water .
pool <unk> <unk> discovered some notable examples during research in hungary .
she found nitrate - rich water in a <unk> <unk> ( the <unk> bath in <unk> ) and a thermal bath filled with <unk> water in a bottle - shaped building ( <unk> <unk> in <unk> ) in addition to magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 000 - year - old <unk> baths in budapest .
many of the heated <unk> baths in switzerland and austria , on the other hand , offer spectacular views . you can view all of <unk> from a <unk> bath or look out on the snow - <unk> <unk> from an <unk> pool in <unk> <unk> . and there is a window in the steam bath giving a view of the action on the ski <unk> .
perhaps the most unusual pool design awaits <unk> in <unk> . the <unk> <unk> in <unk> looks like a <unk> has just landed in the alps .
it <unk> during the winter from three open - <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> mountains behind it .
<unk> in the black forest
pool <unk> <unk> was not greeted by the smell of <unk> in every <unk> pool .
a lot of thermal baths smell of sulphur . the <unk> baths in <unk> , hungary , smell so strongly of oil you may find it difficult to believe you are in a health spa .
the smell comes from the hydrogen <unk> in the <unk> water . the water is almost black with silt that sticks to the skin as soon as you <unk> into the pool - a <unk> experience of a particular kind .
<unk> <unk> , however , was at one point disappointed in her search for beautiful <unk> places . when she tried to visit the <unk> pool at the czech baths of <unk> , she found the area sealed off .
the baths , designed by the architect <unk> <unk> in 0000 , have been closed .
when <unk> looked through the weather - beaten <unk> of the red , white and yellow art <unk> building , she could see weeds growing up through the <unk> .
one place where <unk> has been stopped in its <unk> is a <unk> <unk> bath in the black forest - the <unk> thermal in bad <unk> .
the baths have already gone through three stages of construction . you will not only discover neo - <unk> elements from the period after it was built in 0000 , but also a <unk> hall in <unk> style added around 0000 .
following its careful modernisation in 0000 , the <unk> thermal is the favourite <unk> pool of pool <unk> <unk> <unk> - and not just because she comes from the black forest .
" it is a real achievement to harmonise such different architectural <unk> so <unk> , " says <unk> .
a <unk> in the thermal pool in such a palace is clearly of secondary importance .
agricultural commodities speculation
deutsche bank has commodity trading investigated
by christian <unk>
will deutsche bank stop trading agricultural commodities ?
according to <unk> online , <unk> <unk> has given a working group the task of investigating the consequences of speculation for the poor around the world .
the ceo plans to make changes in january .
<unk> -
for german citizens the situation is clear . according to one study , 00 percent of germans find it unacceptable that banks <unk> on agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize .
two thirds of those questioned demand that deutsche bank and other banks cease trading in agricultural commodities , as trading <unk> the problems faced by the very poorest people around the world .
the findings were made in a survey conducted by the <unk> institute for social research and statistical analysis on behalf of the consumer organisation <unk> .
the study is based on a report presented by <unk> in mid - october .
the author of the report , <unk> <unk> , shows that <unk> on global commodities exchanges <unk> up prices - and the banks are therefore complicit in global hunger .
the campaign by consumer advocates is directed specifically at the head of deutsche bank , <unk> <unk> , although large banking houses such as goldman sachs and <unk> <unk> trade in the same way .
originally , commodity <unk> was designed as a means of protecting traders against price fluctuations .
however , most experts now agree that the <unk> have left behind the rules of supply and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the poorest .
in contrast to us competitors , <unk> has responded to the criticism . he has promised to investigate the accusations and has said that no trade is " worth putting deutsche bank 's good reputation at risk . "
according to <unk> online , an international working group is currently investigating the accusations contained in the <unk> report .
the investigation should be complete by the end of the year when the findings will be presented to deutsche bank 's board of managing directors - with recommendations for action .
the head of the bank then plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of january .
commodities trading may be reduced or stopped completely .
<unk> working on his image
the president of <unk> , <unk> bode , welcomed the news while emphasising his criticism of the financial sector . " <unk> on rising food prices is an extreme example of how thoughtlessly banks are currently acting against the common interest . "
as top bank lobbyist , <unk> has a particular duty , according to bode .
" deutsche bank must remove all investments from its portfolio that <unk> money on food prices , " said bode .
" it does not matter whether this is about starving people or the reputation of deutsche bank . "
<unk> 's sensitive response is at first surprising , but then the ceo would like to present a perfect image just a few months before the end of his term in office .
deutsche bank announced on monday that the chairman will not move to the supervisory board as had been planned .
cancelling contentious food commodity speculation could improve his image .
he also need have little concern for the costs - it would be up to his successor to manage the outcome .
one in two people would withdraw commodities investments
<unk> is striving to keep up the pressure on the manager .
to date , more than 00,000 internet users have joined the organisation 's campaign .
bode published the survey on tuesday . the survey was conducted for the <unk> institute for social research and statistical analysis on 0 and 0 november and 0000 people took part .
no more than eleven percent think it is legitimate for deutsche bank to offer investments that <unk> on the price of foodstuffs .
many banking customers would also take direct action if they discover that their bank is involved in such trading . according to the survey , one in two would withdraw investments that end up in commodities speculation .
00 percent would recommend leaving the bank , 00 percent said they would think about closing their account and switching to a different bank .
<unk> <unk> in vienna
the relocated <unk>
by <unk> <unk>
an architectural history with <unk> , lows and a happy - ever - after . austria 's <unk> for the 0000 world 's fair in brussels won <unk> , became a museum in vienna , stood empty and was abandoned .
now it is being reopened as an exhibition centre .
austria 's <unk> , designed by karl <unk> for the 0000 brussels world 's fair , is a famous textbook example of modern post - war architecture with its clear shapes , glass halls , bold <unk> and the new construction materials that expressed belief in technical progress .
<unk> 's <unk> won the grand <unk> <unk> in 0000 for its light <unk> steel - glass structure .
the building is considered a milestone in contemporary architecture .
it made the architect so famous that he also built austria 's <unk> at the next world 's fair .
he finally shot to <unk> internationally in 0000 with his <unk> four - <unk> <unk> tower and its <unk> - shaped <unk> building .
the <unk> , planned as a temporary exhibition building , was relocated to the <unk> <unk> near vienna 's <unk> , converted and opened as the museum of the 00th century in 0000 - and is widely referred to as the " <unk> <unk> " for this reason .
however , the building was not suitable as a museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls to <unk> <unk> and poor air conditioning .
nonetheless , it continued to be used until contemporary art in vienna was given a new home .
the building stood empty from 0000 and fell into a worse and worse state of repair .
the architect <unk> <unk> has now renovated the <unk> , which has been named the " <unk> <unk> " and will be used as a contemporary art museum .
the museum is a branch of the <unk> museum , which will open the first exhibition on tuesday evening - a delight in every respect .
<unk> <unk> - <unk> who became the new director of the austrian <unk> <unk> in 0000 was instrumental in the new beginning .
<unk> - <unk> , an art history <unk> with a remarkable career in her youth as an ice <unk> , who went on to <unk> 's , the <unk> museum and to become the founding director of the museum der <unk> in salzburg , convinced politicians and <unk> to go ahead with renovation , attracted public funding and private sponsorship and decided on the use of the building .
the new museum was to house the <unk> <unk> foundation 's permanent collection , a café and a <unk> alongside contemporary art . an office building was also to be built .
strict supervision & limited budget
<unk> was then the ideal choice to carry out the project .
he was known , of course , for having renovated and expanded joseph <unk> 's secession in vienna , and had won the competition , but he also studied under <unk> at the vienna university of technology and the <unk> was an " exceptionally important place " for him where had visited <unk> " almost every weekend . "
he knew the original design and knew the issues the building was facing , a building that had already lost some of its <unk> and <unk> when it was relocated to vienna and converted .
the problems facing the latest alterations were much greater . the building was " an energy <unk> , " says <unk> .
the window profiles of the glass <unk> were replaced , <unk> - reinforced safety glass was put in and the glass <unk> was replaced by high - <unk> safety glass .
thermal bridge steel <unk> were strengthened or replaced and asbestos was removed from ceilings .
two lower floors created space for the new use of the building , a <unk> light well between the building and the street provides lighting , a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building , but still the delicate <unk> <unk> .
the original external doors have been retained and the building has been painted in the old red - brown colour of <unk> - <unk> .
and the cinema hall is exactly as it used to be .
all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a limited budget .
" we often had to find a material that was good , cheap and met with the approval of the monument authority , " says <unk> , pointing to the rough <unk> in the <unk> .
the building has remained flexible and light despite the constraints , problems and <unk> .
<unk> stated recently that the <unk> " from brussels " had been tough - a typical " drop in the city " story .
architecture like this is " always in the wrong place " and nonetheless wants to " stimulate a real awareness . "
the <unk> <unk> is very much in the right place , as there has been a <unk> of luck in town planning . the completely <unk> " main station quarter " with offices and residential properties is developing around the <unk> <unk> .
there may also be a second <unk> of luck . the <unk> <unk> may be bolstered by another <unk> building - the <unk> francesca <unk> <unk> has purchased the <unk> <unk> berlin and is reported to be negotiating with the city for a neighbouring location in the <unk> <unk> .
deutsche bahn plans winter crisis package into the millions
deutsche bahn has come up with a crisis plan to prevent train cancellations in the winter .
the number of employees is to double .
the costs will run into the millions .
according to a newspaper report , deutsche bahn will spend more than 00 million euros more this year in the battle to prevent winter - time cancellations and delays .
referring to an internal crisis plan at deutsche bahn , the <unk> newspaper has reported that investment of around 000 million euros in total is planned up to 0000 .
investment is intended to improve the availability of locomotives and the rail network , even in the face of extreme weather conditions .
the number of internal and external employees involved in removing snow from rail facilities and platforms is to double to 00,000 .
the aim is to clear platforms of snow and ice by start of business and 00 percent of the critical points within four to five hours .
<unk> <unk> , head of deutsche bahn , warned of train cancellations and delays this winter at a summit with government and industry two months ago .
last winter , deutsche bahn had considerable difficulties in its passenger business , as it lacked reserves in the face of difficult weather conditions .
numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the federal railway office .
there is also some delay in the delivery of ice trains .
deutsche bahn has also been forced to have the axles of ice trains checked significantly more frequently for many years , after an ice train 's <unk> broke in cologne 's main station .
deutsche bank pays multi - million pound fine in the usa
fresh trouble is following hard on the heels of the uproar around <unk> <unk> , ceo of deutsche bank : deutsche bank faces a multi - million pound fine in the usa .
as if the problems at home were not already enough for deutsche bank , the industry giant 's past in the usa is now also <unk> up with it . frankfurt - based deutsche bank will pay 000 million dollars ( 000 million euros ) to settle disputes arising from the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis .
the issue centres on the sale of mortgage securities .
the national credit union administration ( <unk> ) , a financial market <unk> , <unk> a <unk> of major banks of having used false promises to mislead credit unions into buying the financial products .
the value of the securities dropped dramatically during the financial crisis and brought down the credit unions .
" we are happy to have resolved the issue without the parties going to court , " said a deutsche bank spokesman in new york .
the bank did not admit culpability in the settlement .
the same is true of <unk> , which agreed to pay 00.0 million dollars .
the <unk> chairman , <unk> <unk> , welcomed the <unk> of the two banks .
the national credit union administration ( <unk> ) is responsible for the us credit unions and <unk> in <unk> to protect customer deposits .
the <unk> is fighting for compensation for losses that run into the billions .
the current settlements are the first of their kind .
the <unk> had also approached other major banks and <unk> <unk> chase , the royal bank of scotland and goldman sachs in the summer .
the dubious mortgage securities are so - called mortgage - backed securities .
they are underpinned by home loans .
this sealed the fate of a number of financial companies when the us property bubble exploded in 0000 .
the us investment bank , <unk> <unk> , went <unk> up in september 0000 at the height of the financial crisis .
the banks battling against a strong wind in the usa several years later .
investors and regulators have brought a vast number of claims for compensation or to punish <unk> .
the federal housing finance agency ( <unk> ) has been behind the largest wave of claims .
it <unk> 00 major international banks of having taken in us lenders <unk> <unk> and <unk> mac on mortgage transactions valued at around 000 billion dollars .
deutsche bank also faces legal action by the <unk> covering multiple transactions with a total value of 00.0 billion dollars from 0000 to 0000 .
the <unk> is demanding that the frankfurt - based bank take responsibility for " substantial losses , " but has not yet specified the exact sum .
deutsche bank has rejected the claims as <unk> and has declared its intention to <unk> off the claims .
<unk> <unk> pumps 00 billion into <unk>
financial <unk> <unk> is investing heavily in the it company , <unk> .
since march , he has bought up shares <unk> more than ten billion dollars .
until now , the major american investor , <unk> <unk> , had always claimed not to invest in it and <unk> companies , as it was difficult to forecast the long - term development .
however , <unk> 's annual reports changed his mind on investing in the industry .
according to <unk> , he should have realised much earlier that <unk> primarily offers services and purchases computer systems for the it departments of other companies .
investment by <unk> <unk> is considered a <unk> in the financial world .
the it <unk> <unk> has now earned the title of " sir <unk> . "
<unk> revealed that he had purchased <unk> shares <unk> 00.0 billion dollars since march on the us business news <unk> <unk> .
his investment holding company , berkshire <unk> , has become one of the largest shareholders in <unk> with a 0.0 percent stake .
<unk> said that even <unk> knew nothing of his involvement until recently .
he praised the management , which has managed to bring in profits even during the economic crisis .
" they have done a great job , " said <unk> , referring to the management strategy .
for a fairly long time , <unk> has focused on lucrative it services such as data centres .
the computer <unk> - now more than 000 years old - also provides software and <unk> services , as well as powerful business computers .
<unk> had avoided technology firms to date .
he claimed only to invest in companies whose business he understands
and invested in a freight railway , for example , a <unk> manufacturer and a machine manufacturer .
his holding company , berkshire <unk> , owns shares in a long list of major companies such as <unk> - <unk> and munich re ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) alongside around 00 of its own <unk> .
the 00 - year - old took over the small textile company berkshire <unk> in the 0000s and built it up , with clever investments , into one of the most valuable companies in the world .
his lifestyle , however , has remained <unk> ,
making him a cult figure for countless investors around the world .
his almost infallible <unk> for making money has earned him a <unk> as the " <unk> from <unk> . "
the <unk> share price rose by one percent before the markets opened following the announcement of <unk> 's investment .
" big blue , " as <unk> is also known , is worth more than 000 billion dollars on the stock exchange , making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world alongside apple and microsoft .
<unk> , however , has said he is not planning to invest in microsoft .
the founder , bill gates , is a close friend .
imminent danger
following the discovery of the " <unk> <unk> , " turkish media express doubt about the rule of law in germany .
one newspaper speaks of a " bloody ideology " that is now resurfacing .
the murder of eight turkish and one greek <unk> between 0000 and 0000 was the result of right - wing extremist ideology .
fear and concern has been the reaction to this report in turkey and within the german - turkish community in germany .
for many german turks , the news brings back to life a long - dead spectre . there has been no comparable right - wing extremist violence against turks since the arson attacks in <unk> in november 0000 and in <unk> in may 0000 .
there was never any question , however , that xenophobia does exist in germany .
the right - wing extremist network that has now been discovered , however , is on a scale that has not yet been fully understood .
" is this a revival of the bloody ideology ? " was the <unk> of the internet edition of the turkish newspaper <unk> .
the <unk> newspaper , on the other hand , points out that one of the perpetrators was a confidential <unk> for the intelligence services and expresses concern that the german authorities may be caught up in the right - wing extremist <unk> .
the turkish community of germany ( <unk> ) reacted calmly , remembering the victims of racial violence during a silent <unk> in front of the <unk> gate at the weekend .
just two weeks earlier , the turkish community in berlin had <unk> the <unk> anniversary of the german - turkish bilateral agreement on labour recruitment in a ceremony with german and turkish politicians .
cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story .
the coverage by some turkish media has been like a slap in the face . " germany 's present on the <unk> anniversary " is the title of one article on the <unk> x turkish internet platform , which comments on the circumstances around the series of murders .
the german edition of <unk> also does not miss the chance to make this connection .
" it is beginning to <unk> , " is the title of the <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
he points out that people have been murdered who had paid taxes and made an important contribution to germany 's <unk> with their work .
the behaviour of the police and the subsequently successful <unk> is heavily criticised on german - turkish internet forums .
the authors are asking themselves why the german authorities did not think earlier to look for suspects in right - wing extremist circles .
some <unk> even go as far as some strong rhetoric . " if things continue to be done so <unk> - <unk> , migrants have no option but armed self - defence . "
" that will be the best self - defence . "
" peace in germany depends very strongly on how the entire network is uncovered and on the appropriateness of punishment , " writes " <unk> . "
the attacks on <unk> and <unk> in the 00s are an example of what it means for peace in germany to be at risk .
the photo of the burnt out ruin of <unk> is deeply <unk> in german and turkish memory .
no other event has shown the turks living here more clearly that there is imminent danger and shown the germans that mistrust and distance can culminate in real violence .
the attacks , however , increased the sense of turkish unity .
do not repeat the mistakes of the past
the turkish press at the time complained mainly of the failure of german policy following the attacks . <unk> kohl declined to visit the <unk> in <unk> .
he sent a telegram of <unk> to the turkish president after the arson attack in <unk> , but it was his foreign minister , klaus <unk> , who took his place at the memorial ceremony in cologne - <unk> summed up in his speech the taxes turks contribute in germany ,
just as if he were calculating the value of a person by the taxes he pays .
the coverage by the turkish media at the time again shows how deep the mistrust of many german turks in the current german state has become since .
straight talking is what is needed now , alongside efforts to identify and reassess right - wing extremist terrorism in germany .
the lake <unk> banking scandal
the most risk - taking bank in europe is not in italy or france , but in switzerland .
<unk> almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been struggling from one crisis to the next ever since .
a german is now to bring it back in line .
<unk> weber certainly had not imagined that would be his role .
after his spectacular departure from the head of the federal bank , it was announced in july that he would be starting an almost equally spectacular new job in 0000 : chairman of the board of directors of the major swiss bank <unk> - an unexpected and lucrative career move .
<unk> weber was clearly delighted , praising switzerland for its <unk> and <unk> for its newly won <unk> and making some friendly remarks about his future colleagues .
" <unk> has managed to turn around . "
" i am looking forward to working with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . "
but by september it was already clear that everything would be very different .
a <unk> trader in london had bypassed all the bank 's security systems and <unk> away around 0.0 billion euros .
<unk> ceo , <unk> <unk> - a <unk> not only famous in switzerland - had to go .
the <unk> chairman has been considered ailing ever since - and everyone is asking : when will <unk> weber finally arrive ?
weber is to advise the bank from february 0000 .
and he will take on the role of chairman of the board in may , and not in 0000 , the bank announced on tuesday .
that will be tough for <unk> weber .
he is an economics professor and central <unk> , not a conventional <unk> , and clearly would need some time to adjust .
all at once , he is taking on responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has once again proven that it has long deserved the title of " europe 's biggest banking scandal . "
<unk> is both huge - it was the biggest asset manager in the world until recently - and has been struggling from one scandal to the next for years .
the proud swiss bank , it seems , is to be spared nothing .
it began in the financial crisis .
<unk> had an excellent reputation until 0000 .
the bank combined the image of the secretive and solid , but equally <unk> asset manager with ambitious targets , aiming to become a major player in investment banking .
as a result , in 0000 <unk> was managing 0.0 billion , thereby managing more more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world ,
and had risen to the league of the world 's biggest banks as an investment bank .
that made an impression .
the former <unk> and long - standing banking professor at the swiss institute of banking of the university of <unk> , hans <unk> , explains : " i always presented <unk> to my students as the model of a good bank . "
" from what we know today , you have to ask how i could be so wrong . "
he was very wrong indeed .
it only became clear in 0000 that something was really going very wrong at <unk> .
in the middle of the year , ceo peter <unk> - considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant <unk> - suddenly stepped down .
some months later we could guess at why he had left .
the investment division of the bank had <unk> on subprime securities and was forced to write off billions .
<unk> announced a capital increase , believe it or not , of 00 billion swiss <unk> to face the crisis .
the bank actually managed to find investors , but investors many <unk> would have respectfully declined a short while earlier - a less than transparent asian sovereign wealth fund from singapore and an <unk> sovereign wealth fund that was so secretive , even its name was not disclosed .
that was just the first blow .
it got a lot worse in april 0000 .
the bank was forced to announce new losses running into the billions and chairman of the board of directors , <unk> <unk> - the second best paid chairman in switzerland in 0000 - resigned .
catastrophe followed in october 0000 . <unk> faced collapse from a lack of investment during the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state .
the national bank bought up toxic securities from <unk> for <unk> billions and the swiss confederation paid six billion swiss <unk> for a mandatory <unk> <unk> to become part <unk> of the bank .
the whole of switzerland was shocked - the country recognised the dramatic consequences for a small country of being home to such large banks .
after all , the balance sheet total for <unk> in 0000 was more than five times the economic output of switzerland ( see <unk> ) .
" we would not be able to save the <unk> for a second time , " says banking researcher <unk> .
the second catastrophe followed closely on the heels of the first .
a few months later , <unk> <unk> in the tax dispute with the usa and declared that it was prepared to hand over the data of wealthy clients who had potentially avoided paying tax with the help of the bank .
<unk> also agreed to pay 000 million dollars consisting of <unk> of unjustified profits from the business and a penalty .
<unk> therefore more or less admitted having been an accessory to tax evasion .
at the same time , <unk> lost something that had always been its advantage when competing for rich clients - the <unk> of secrecy .
swiss banking secrecy was not the same after the scandal .
the ceo and the chairman then resigned and
the exodus of client money began .
the bank had lost its credibility in both of its core business divisions within a few months - in investment banking thanks to bad speculation and in asset management by aiding and <unk> tax evasion .
and just as things had <unk> down and <unk> looked like it would start to turn things around , along came a disastrous rogue trader . a single trader <unk> away 0.0 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong .
one thing is clear - risk management in the investment banking division is still not working .
" the <unk> incident clearly showed that risk control had changed too little , " says martin <unk> , economic and professor of finance at the swiss banking institute of the university of <unk> .
the <unk> of one major german bank also has no doubts : " the problem facing <unk> is that it does not having a handle on risk control . "
it was precisely the concept of caution that had long ago made swiss <unk> the guardians of the world 's major assets - no excessive risk , but security for money , whether the world fell apart outside the <unk> republic or not .
the <unk> of swiss banks had become a symbol of <unk> reliability , just as <unk> and <unk> had come to <unk> sophisticated <unk> .
the <unk> headquarters in <unk> still fit the <unk> of the <unk> swiss private bank - just a bit bigger .
the location alone is classic .
the bank has its head office on <unk> 's <unk> that leads from the main station directly to <unk> lake , surrounded by the snow - <unk> <unk> of the swiss mountains .
the buildings are <unk> and the shop rates are among the highest in europe .
<unk> such as <unk> 's are to be found here between traditional swiss shops such as <unk> <unk> .
the swiss banks have <unk> here for hundreds of years - from the national bank to the palace of credit <unk> and elite private banks such as <unk> <unk> .
a heavy revolving door opens onto the <unk> reception .
the walls within are <unk> in <unk> behind vast <unk> <unk> . there is a large sign to the " safe " next to the bank 's logo .
<unk> knows that its clients are looking for - security .
but both the major swiss banks , <unk> and credit <unk> , at some point <unk> the swiss banking concept - or <unk> it , as the head of one small swiss private bank believes .
he would prefer not to see his name in the newspaper - he too , like all swiss <unk> , does business with the two major banks .
he believes <unk> has grown too big - particularly in investment banking where the anglo - <unk> are also very active .
in his opinion , the swiss have nothing to add .
" and if they do , they have adapted to the customs of the anglo - <unk> long ago . "
it was in fact anglo - saxon investment banking that changed <unk> , brought in its first big profits - and then the debacle . no other european financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime <unk> as the major swiss bank .
the catastrophe became evident on 00 october 0000 .
" that wednesday , the government coalition of a small country with a population of seven million undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of the nation , " writes author <unk> <unk> in his book the <unk> <unk> .
the politicians approved up to 00 billion swiss <unk> ( around 00 billion euros ) to save the bank from bankruptcy .
how could it have come to that ?
talking to swiss banks , they see the issue mainly in the size of <unk> .
two of the three major swiss banks consolidated into a single , vast group in june 0000 .
a bank was created that was already too big for small switzerland when the merger was agreed - and a bank that continued to grow .
the fact that the two banks that went to form <unk> complemented each other helped . one was a wealthy but <unk> bank <unk> in asset management in <unk> and the other was less wealthy , but much more <unk> .
the <unk> investment <unk> suddenly had access to a lot of money that they could use to turn an <unk> wheel .
two names are connected with the rise of <unk> : peter <unk> , group ceo of <unk> from 0000 to 0000 , and <unk> <unk> , chairman of the board of directors .
" i always thought that <unk> and <unk> were a dream team , " says the banking research , hans <unk> .
" <unk> , highly intellectual , modest , with a deep understanding of models and statistics , and <unk> , with <unk> <unk> who had worked his way up from being a <unk> 's <unk> . "
but <unk> in the end relied on <unk> .
and <unk> ultimately may have made a critical error . " he thought his models were reality , " says <unk> .
" that is tragic . "
tragic it may be .
pride comes before a fall .
employees of <unk> clearly remember the management meetings where ceo <unk> always repeated the same slogan - <unk> goldman sachs .
the american bank was the world 's most powerful investment bank .
it led the " league tables " that documented the success of the banks at that time .
<unk> wanted to get to the very top of the league .
it managed some of the way .
<unk> was a major player in foreign exchange and stocks .
commissioned management consultants , however , pointed out a weakness . in terms of what in banking terminology is referred to as " fixed income , " <unk> was far behind the very largest banks .
<unk> had gaps in its us mortgage products .
to <unk> the hole , <unk> entered on an adventure that almost cost it its existence .
hungry for growth , the bank itself and a hedge fund founded by the bank invested in us subprime securities .
it developed into a vast machine that <unk> up securities based on us mortgage credit and passed them on - while itself continuing to bear risks .
even when other banks had long been looking for a way out , <unk> carried on .
" <unk> was buying as late as the summer of 0000 when the us housing market was in flames , " says banking expert <unk> .
the greater the rise , the greater the fall .
one manager after the next had to go as the attempts to clean up proved more difficult than anticipated .
posts at <unk> became a game of <unk> chairs and remain uncertain to this day .
any head of the major bank now has an almost impossible job .
he must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models .
banking expert <unk> already has an idea - quit investment banking , focus on asset management and turn back to swiss roots .
the bank , however , is not ( yet ) prepared to go that far .
it is clear , nonetheless , that investment banking must <unk> significantly .
the new head of the bank , sergio <unk> , plans to present his future strategy to the world on tuesday .
the 00 - year - old <unk> - swiss <unk> was actually only imagined as a transitional solution when the bank <unk> ways unexpectedly with his predecessor <unk> .
since then , he has proved his <unk> and is now to head <unk> permanently , the <unk> - based bank announced on tuesday .
<unk> plans to take the investment bank back to where it was in the mid - 00s .
he is cutting 0000 jobs .
but that will not be enough .
<unk> needs a vision .
what is <unk> ?
how does it plan to make money ?
those are the questions <unk> weber is definitely already asking himself .
publicly , he has only so far that he and his wife will look for a flat in <unk> .
next year .

a solution to the problem birds , however , is far from within reach .
experts at the first <unk> <unk> in the east <unk> town of <unk> have said that <unk> can no longer be forced out of cities .

" the <unk> and the sorrow " <unk> <unk> across other <unk> of war : the alps , the balkans , the eastern front , <unk> , east africa .
soldiers in this book have <unk> fall on them ; one has christmas in egypt under the <unk> ; <unk> flies are an <unk> problem .
this is a moving book , almost from the start .
war floods these people 's lives like a natural catastrophe , a <unk> <unk> that <unk> of <unk> .
when <unk> fire is heard in the distance , and you are a woman at home with your children , do you stay or <unk> ?
who is coming , anyway ?
almost no one understands what 's happening , even why this war is to be fought .
" lack of facts , " mr. <unk> <unk> , " has been <unk> out with <unk> , <unk> , hopes , fears , <unk> fixes , conspiracy theories , dreams , <unk> and <unk> . "
" the <unk> and the sorrow " follows individuals like florence <unk> , an english <unk> in the russian army , and richard <unk> , a young german high - seas fleet <unk> .
their stories are mostly taken from <unk> , letters and other already published material .
the accounts of their lives can be terrifying or <unk> , but are most fully alive in mr. <unk> 's accumulation of small moments , stray details .
many of these are about deprivation and making do .
in telling a german <unk> 's story he says : " <unk> , everywhere <unk> . "
" substitute coffee , fake <unk> , <unk> rubber , paper <unk> , wooden <unk> . "
he goes on about the <unk> food in germany .
he describes " meat made of pressed rice <unk> in <unk> fat ( and finished off with a fake bone made of wood ) ; tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato <unk> ; shoes <unk> with wood . "
there are , he notes , " 000 registered meat substitutes permissible in the production of <unk> , 000 registered coffee substitutes . "
some stories are about <unk> and bravery .
one american <unk> his own <unk> toward <unk> and <unk> about war : " you feel that , after all , this is what men were intended for rather than to sit in easy chairs with a cigarette and <unk> , the evening paper or the best <unk> , and to pretend that such a <unk> means <unk> and that there is no barbarian behind your <unk> and <unk> <unk> front . "
conversely a british soldier <unk> that he will most likely die , and that no one will notice or care .
" once one is resigned to the thought of sacrificing oneself , one would like to think that it might happen in front of an audience , " he writes .
instead , it is <unk> like " a condemned man being <unk> <unk> . "
other observations are about an old europe falling away , and about new types of terror .
" the conflict has increasingly become an economic competition , " mr. <unk> writes , " a war between factories . "
he catches the arrival of what he calls " a new species in the <unk> of the young century : the articulate and ideologically convinced mass murderer in well - cut clothes who performs his <unk> while sitting behind a desk . "
people behave in <unk> ways ; there is as much base <unk> as heroism .
mr. <unk> discussed the soldiers who actively tried to catch a <unk> disease from <unk> as a way to evade service at the front .
" the most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of <unk> <unk> , which soldiers buy and <unk> into their <unk> in the hope of ending up in hospital , " he writes .
" those who are really desperate <unk> it into their eyes , which often results in lifelong blindness . "
in this translation from the swedish by peter <unk> , mr. <unk> 's <unk> is <unk> but <unk> , perfectly suited to his humane task .
in dozens of small scenes he catches the way the war has " unleashed uniquely <unk> forces : extreme nationalism , social revolution , religious hatred . "
people begin to ask why their leaders are making them fight .
the best books about world war i have often been <unk> , like paul <unk> 's " great war and modern memory , " or <unk> , like <unk> maria <unk> 's " all quiet on the western front , " rather than comprehensive <unk> .
mr. <unk> 's volume joins an unconventional <unk> .
his book has the most devastating ending i can remember in a piece of <unk> .
i wo n't give it away .
but it 's as if he has reached from his book , snatched that <unk> personae page from your fingers , and <unk> it with a match .
after an earlier <unk> , a <unk> planned <unk>
hundreds of police officers were involved , some of them <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the overnight hours of monday into tuesday were chosen because <unk> park would be at its <unk> .
the operation was kept secret from all but a few high - ranking officers , with others initially being told that they were embarking on an exercise .
police commissioner raymond <unk> <unk> was at the <unk> , his presence <unk> how the operation was fraught with challenges for the police department .
there could be no repeat of <unk> in recent weeks , like the <unk> - spraying of protesters , that violated department rules and created a <unk> of public sympathy for the <unk> .
and so the police operation to clear <unk> park of protesters <unk> after two weeks of planning and training .
officials had prepared by watching how occupations in other cities played out .
a major disaster <unk> was held on <unk> island , with an eye toward <unk> .
officials increased so - called disorder training - <unk> measures that involve moving large numbers of police officers quickly - to focus on lower manhattan .
the last training session was on monday night , on the manhattan side of the east river .
the orders to move into the park came down at the " last minute , " said someone familiar with the orders , which referred to the <unk> only as " an exercise . "
" the few <unk> that i know that were called into this thing , they were not told it was for going into <unk> park , " said the person , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
" the only people who were aware of them going into <unk> park were at the very highest levels of the department . "
one reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city .
on <unk> 00 , officials wanted to clear the park , but then backed off as hundreds of protesters <unk> in ahead of time after hearing of the plans .
the operation on tuesday involved officers from various police units , including <unk> task forces - scores of mobile officers who are usually used to flood high - crime <unk> .
mr. <unk> said many people , almost like commuters , had been coming and going from the park during the day , making 0 a.m. a good time to move in .
" it was appropriate to do it when the smallest number of people were in the park , " he said .
emergency service unit trucks with <unk> lights and <unk> gathered at <unk> slip and the <unk> <unk> <unk> drive , near the manhattan bridge , before moving out .
the lights and <unk> messages booming from the <unk> seemed to cow many protesters .
as the community affairs officers moved into the park in their light - blue <unk> , many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left .
no <unk> were touched until <unk> a.m. , the police said , giving the protesters time to gather their belongings .
other teams of officers were seen gathering on the <unk> to move in if arrests were needed in the park .
reporters in the park were forced to leave .
paul <unk> <unk> , the police department 's chief spokesman , said it was for their safety .
but many journalists said that they had been prevented from seeing the police take action in the park , and that they had been roughly handled by officers .
mr. <unk> said television <unk> trucks on church street , along the park 's western border , were able to capture images .
as the police moved west through the dense <unk> of protesters " personal belongings , including luggage and plastic <unk> and leaf bags <unk> with clothing , crews from the <unk> department followed , <unk> up what was left behind .
some protesters who refused to move were dragged out , the images appearing on the internet soon after .
a core group of protesters took up positions close to the <unk> 's kitchen area , near the <unk> of the park .
some made a barrier , and the police moved in to <unk> arrest them .
about 00 people in the <unk> of the <unk> locked themselves together by their arms .
and two people chained themselves to trees , mr. <unk> said .
emergency service officers were called in to cut the <unk> .
no arrests were made in the park until about <unk> a.m. , mr. <unk> said .
the clearing operation was complete about 00 minutes later , the police said .
mr. <unk> said about 000 people were arrested in the park .
most of the arrests were for " <unk> conduct and resisting arrest , " he said .
the highest - ranking officer on the scene was joseph <unk> <unk> , the chief of department , the top <unk> officer in the department .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , the department 's chief of <unk> , was also there .
mr. <unk> , while present , was " not directing operations , " mr. <unk> said .
a second group of officers waited along the eastern side of <unk> , between liberty and <unk> streets , in case they had to move in .
<unk> were set up at <unk> street , a block north of the park , and at <unk> street , a block south .
from those positions , the police were seen expanding the <unk> even <unk> outward from <unk> park .
at one point , several officers , many with shields , were seen pushing people <unk> out .
about 00 people were on the northern <unk> .
some of the <unk> action of the night took place south of the park .
around 0 a.m. , south of <unk> street , one <unk> jumped on the <unk> of a police car , and others were seen releasing the air from the tires of a police van .
at one point , a piece of <unk> came flying from the <unk> .
in the end , one officer and one <unk> were <unk> .
support workers ' union will <unk> city over <unk>
the union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to <unk> the city on wednesday , claiming the <unk> were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students .
the <unk> is possibly the last weapon available to the union , <unk> council 00 , in its effort to reverse the <unk> .
six hundred seventy - two school <unk> , parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city 's lowest paid lost their jobs on <unk> 0 , in a move union leaders have described as political payback for their refusal to let the city access a health care fund run by <unk> groups to close its budget gap last spring .
city officials have categorically denied that accusation .
at a city council hearing last month , schools chancellor <unk> <unk> <unk> said the <unk> were a part of the budget they signed off on in june .
one council member fired back , telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be laid off .
<unk> council 00 officials said they filed a notice of claim , warning the department of education that it would be <unk> ; it will hold a news conference on wednesday to announce the <unk> 's filing formally , in state supreme court in manhattan .
the suit will list mr. <unk> and the city 's department of education as defendants , and counts eight laid - off workers as <unk> , all of them black or <unk> women , as were most of the <unk> who lost their jobs .
elizabeth <unk> , a <unk> for the city 's law department , said the city had not seen the <unk> and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations .
according to a draft of the complaint obtained by the new york times , the union has <unk> in on the number of <unk> at schools in poor parts of the city to support a claim of <unk> treatment , saying poor schools lost more <unk> because they had been chronically <unk> .
it points out that while there were no <unk> on <unk> island and few <unk> in schools in the upper east side or <unk> , 00 school <unk> lost their jobs in <unk> 00 in <unk> , <unk> , and 00 were let go in districts 0 and 0 in the south <unk> .
noting the loss of five out of eight school <unk> employed by public school 00 in <unk> , where 00 percent of the students live in poverty , the <unk> says , " this is not a <unk> of well - <unk> parents who can fund - raise to make up the budget shortfalls . "
<unk> 00 " s budget was cut by 0.00 percent this year , and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the extra financing for each poor student schools <unk> .
the union also claims that high school <unk> may have been <unk> by the language in a memo <unk> the dismissal of parent coordinators .
the memo used the word " excess " to describe the action , even though " excess " more commonly describes the act of moving a teacher from a school 's payroll into a pool of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office .
" sixty - six parent coordinators were laid off , " the draft complaint says , " and not merely <unk> . "
mission over , congress ready to agree on libya
it finally looks like <unk> and democrats on <unk> hill are ready to agree on something related to the uprising in libya .
all it took was for the revolt to succeed , <unk> dictator <unk> gaddafi to be captured and killed and american involvement to end .
on tuesday , the senate foreign relations committee is to consider a resolution , sponsored by chairman john <unk> ( d - <unk> ) , along with <unk> . john <unk> ( <unk> - <unk> ) and joseph i. <unk> ( i - <unk> ) , <unk> <unk> for their successful <unk> and <unk> troops for their " bravery . "
" this resolution is about <unk> the courageous people of libya as they begin to rebuild their country , " <unk> said .
" it 's an affirmation of <unk> support for their democratic aspirations . "
the language may sound <unk> , but nothing about the libya debate has been easy so far .
this summer , lawmakers from both parties <unk> with each other and the white house over the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or <unk> of the <unk> military 's role in the nato mission in libya .
in june , <unk> and <unk> introduced a resolution <unk> the limited use of <unk> military forces in libya .
the bill was defeated in the house by a wide <unk> margin , and it never came up for a vote in the senate .
but on the same day that bill failed in the house , the chamber also voted down a measure that would have cut funding for american operations in libya .
that left the <unk> mission in a form of legislative purgatory - with congress upset enough to <unk> <unk> 's handling of the mission but not so angry as to actually pull the <unk> out from under it .
then congress 's <unk> was overtaken by events .
tripoli fell to libyan rebels in august , and gaddafi was killed <unk> 00 .
the nato mission officially ended <unk> 00 .
now the senate may be ready to act .
the foreign relations committee resolution " congratulates the people of libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary <unk> in <unk> themselves " and " <unk> the men and women of the united states armed forces and their coalition partners who engaged in military operations to protect the people of libya for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism . "
the resolution also " <unk> the national interest of the united states in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in libya . "
will the new measure earn the full support of the foreign relations panel , or will it split lawmakers like the june bill did ?
the last version was opposed by <unk> richard g. <unk> ( ind . ) , the committee 's top republican .
<unk> 's spokesman said monday that he had not seen the final version of the new bill yet .
across the <unk> , the house is to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget , a top legislative priority of nearly every <unk> republican and some democrats .
the measure , sponsored by <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> - <unk> ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other topic to actually get a floor vote in the house or senate this congress .
other lawmakers have been unsuccessful so far in bringing their amendments to the floor , but not for lack of trying .
<unk> 's is just one of 00 constitutional amendments that have been introduced this congress , <unk> a wide range of topics .
some are <unk> - the same bill offered in both the house and senate - and others are slight variations on each other .
there are at least 00 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the house alone , and another handful that would " control federal spending . "
some of those <unk> are identical too , but they give their sponsors - particularly <unk> <unk> looking to <unk> their <unk> - the chance to <unk> that they " <unk> " such a measure .
the budget control act , which passed in august , required that both the house and senate vote on a balanced budget amendment .
in march , 00 senators voted in <unk> of a non - binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment .
beyond the budget , several members want to limit the number of terms members of congress can serve , while <unk> josé e. <unk> ( d - <unk> ) wants to lift the two - term limit for presidents .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( d - <unk> ) has offered a host of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care , among other subjects .
an amendment prohibiting same - sex marriage is a perennial offering , as is one prohibiting flag - burning .
some lawmakers also want to allow for the <unk> of federal laws if they are opposed by two - thirds of the states .
as eager as members have been to offer amendments , they <unk> not moving at any faster pace than in past years .
in the 000th congress , lawmakers offered 00 such amendments , and they introduced 00 in the 000th .
the pace <unk> in comparison to that of the early 0000s , when members regularly offered more than 000 amendments every two years , according to numbers provided by the senate <unk> .
but they were n't much more successful then than they are now .
the last amendment to be added - the 00th - was ratified in 0000 , but it was actually proposed by congress in 0000 .
" beat up but not beaten , " <unk> speaks in first tv interview since shooting
ten months after a <unk> shot her at point - blank range at a constituent event in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ( d - <unk> ) appeared on national television monday night , <unk> along to the <unk> show tune " the sun will come out tomorrow " and said she wanted to get better more than she wanted to return to congress .
appearing on abc news 's " 00/00 " with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> to formed sentences and needed help walking .
the show documented her difficult journey back from the damage inflicted by a bullet that fractured her <unk> and <unk> the left side of her brain , passing from the front to the back of her head .
three months ago , she made a surprise return to the house to <unk> cast her vote on the debt - ceiling deal .
in her first television interview since the january shooting that killed six and <unk> 00 , <unk> <unk> , laughed and <unk> - and described her recovery as " difficult . "
asked by <unk> how she feels , <unk> , 00 , responded , " pretty good . "
the interview with <unk> and her husband , <unk> mark <unk> , was part of an hour - long " 00/00 " special that aired on the eve of the release of the couple 's new book , " <unk> : a story of courage and hope . "
the special traced <unk> 's recovery since the <unk> 0 shooting .
in videos shot by <unk> in the first few weeks , she is seen in her hospital bed , her head <unk> and a long scar across her <unk> .
she is capable only of holding up one or two fingers as her husband encourages her .
months later , <unk> is seen sitting up in a wheelchair as <unk> teach her how to perform simple actions .
a <unk> of the head .
a <unk> of the lips .
and then , her first word : " what . "
within days , <unk> uttered another word - " <unk> , " a request for a change in her breakfast menu .
videos aired by abc show that music played a central role in <unk> 's recovery : the <unk> is seen singing along with <unk> to <unk> <unk> 's " girls just <unk> have fun " and <unk> petty 's " free <unk> . " "
in the interview with <unk> , <unk> , who goes through two hours of therapy every day , said she has no memory of the day of the shooting .
her husband said that he was reading <unk> a newspaper story about the shooting on march 00 when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had been killed in the incident .
suspected <unk> <unk> lee <unk> is being held at a <unk> prison and is being forcibly <unk> as he awaits trial .
" a lot of people died , " <unk> told <unk> .
" tough , tough , tough . "
at one point in his wife 's recovery , <unk> told <unk> , she said , " i <unk> been beaten . "
" so , i would say , " <unk> , you have not been beaten , " " <unk> said .
you <unk> just been beat up .
and you <unk> going to get through this , and you <unk> going to recover and you <unk> going to come back stronger than ever .
troops feel more pity than respect
the event was a wall street <unk> that raised millions of dollars for homeless <unk> in new york city .
<unk> rock <unk> a <unk> about <unk> , frustration and loss .
on <unk> , several hundred soldiers , sailors , <unk> and <unk> <unk> into position around him .
the black - tie <unk> rose to its feet and <unk> .
" the <unk> and women were regarded as <unk> , " said david <unk> , who <unk> the spring <unk> .
a senior military officer at the <unk> , also attended by the joint <unk> then - chairman , <unk> . <unk> <unk> , saw the troops " role differently .
" they were rolled out like some sort of <unk> <unk> , " the officer wrote in an e - mail .
i <unk> sure the <unk> meant well .
i know they did .
but it was n't respect , really . it was pity .
the <unk> conflicting impressions illustrate the uneasy relationship that has taken hold between the military and an often distant , sometimes <unk> american public .
the troops are <unk> with praise for their sacrifices .
but the praise comes with a price , service members say .
the public increasingly acts as if it feels sorry for those in uniform .
" we are n't victims at all , " said <unk> <unk> sean <unk> <unk> , who <unk> troops in iraq and will soon leave for afghanistan .
" but it seems that the only way that some can be supportive is to cast us in the role of <unk> souls . "
the topic is a sensitive one for military leaders , who do not want to appear <unk> or at odds with the public they serve .
they also <unk> that the anger that returning troops faced in the latter years of the vietnam war was far worse .
as a result , most of the conversations about pity take place quietly and privately among combat <unk> .
after his two sons returned from combat <unk> with the <unk> , retired <unk> . mark <unk> warned them that people outside the military would view their service from two perspectives .
some would look at them with a sense of <unk> because they faced down <unk> and <unk> to <unk> places .
others would wonder whether there was an " angry , violent <unk> beneath the surface , " said <unk> , who fought in iraq and returned to a senior government job in washington .
during his job search , he said , he sensed that some <unk> had <unk> <unk> whether he would be able to hold up under the strain of a demanding washington job immediately after his combat tour .
" when you talk about your service , you need to counter the negative impressions , " <unk> recalled telling his sons .
the military 's <unk> springs , in part , from american indifference to the wars .
<unk> achievements are rarely singled out for praise by a country that has little <unk> with the military and sees little direct benefit from the iraq and afghanistan wars .
" we , as a nation , no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in world war ii , " said retired <unk> <unk> david <unk> , who <unk> <unk> troops in afghanistan .
instead , praise from politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of a service member 's suffering .
troops are recognized for the number of <unk> they have endured , the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries .
military faces mounting pressure to crack down on rape
this week , a landmark hearing will decide whether 00 women and men have a case against the military for alleged inaction on rape .
if not , hundreds of <unk> are <unk> up for the next one .
<unk> . elizabeth <unk> was 00 years old and 00 weeks pregnant the night she says she was <unk> by a fellow soldier .
it was october 0000 , and she was heading back to her <unk> at <unk> air station , just north of san <unk> , after <unk> with a friend when she ran into a male colleague carrying a 00 - pack of beer .
he asked if he could join her in her room for a drink .
" a red flag went up , " <unk> says .
but the texas <unk> <unk> aside her concern .
i thought , no , he 's 00 .
" he 's from texas , " she says .
" i wish i had listened to my <unk> . "
within minutes of entering <unk> 's room , the man came up from behind her , throwing her down and <unk> her , she <unk> .
this week , on <unk> 00 , <unk> and 00 other current and former military personnel will <unk> await a court ruling in a historic hearing to be held in <unk> , <unk> , that will decide whether a suit they have brought against former <unk> secretary robert gates and his predecessor , <unk> <unk> , will go to trial .
the suit <unk> that gates and <unk> failed to curtail widespread rape within the military , in violation of soldiers " constitutional rights .
filed in february by <unk> <unk> , a washington , <unk> , <unk> , the suit initially involved 00 <unk> but grew to 00 in the following months - 00 women and three men , all of whom <unk> that they were <unk> or sexually <unk> by fellow soldiers , and that the military failed to investigate , prosecute , or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks .
<unk> says she is going after the military 's top brass because the problem begins with them .
" the military is a top - down structure , " she says .
" who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of retaliation ? the top leadership . "
<unk> also says that since february , she has been contacted by nearly 000 other <unk> , many of whom could be part of future suits .
her strategy : rather than <unk> all the <unk> into this case - putting all her <unk> in one <unk> , so to speak - she will file multiple cases , if need be , to keep the pressure on .
the <unk> team for the department of <unk> , led by united states <unk> neil <unk> , has filed a motion to dismiss the case .
the court papers , obtained by <unk> , detail the <unk> strategy - essentially , that the military cannot be <unk> by current or former soldiers for injuries incurred in the armed forces .
per a 0000 supreme court ruling called the <unk> doctrine , the federal government is not liable for injury sustained by active - duty personnel .
" the alleged harms are incident to <unk> " military service , " the documents say .
the department of <unk> declined to comment for this story .
things have changed since the '00s .
while women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat , that distinction is in name only : modern wars rarely have clear front lines .
in both iraq and afghanistan , teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles , especially in reaching out to local women in war zones .
the result : between those two wars , 000 female soldiers have died - two thirds of them during combat situations .
it 's time for the military to <unk> as well , <unk> says .
she is n't alone in her fight ; three other lawsuits are under way in addition to <unk> .
at <unk> law school , the <unk> " legal services <unk> is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly fostering a <unk> atmosphere .
separately , the <unk> vietnam <unk> of america is assembling a suit against the military that focuses on the " personality disorder " <unk> assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service - a common occurrence , according to activists such as <unk> <unk> of the service women 's action network , a human - rights group .
her group filed a suit in december against the <unk> administration , charging it with discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefit claims for people who say they were sexually <unk> in the service .
nine separate <unk> have been introduced in congress by a <unk> mix of senators and representatives , proposing a range of fixes .
in 0000 there were 0,000 sexual assaults reported , according to the department of <unk> 's sexual <unk> prevention and response office .
but assaults are notoriously <unk> , and by the <unk> 's own estimate , that figure accounts for approximately 00.0 percent of the estimated 00,000 incidents that occurred that year .
the report , released in march , also examines prosecution rates : in 0000 , 00 percent of reported cases in the military went to trial - half the rate of the civilian justice system .
the <unk> in <unk> 's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of <unk> .
in <unk> 's case , she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred .
that night , she says , she was asked to <unk> the details of her rape 00 separate times to a stream of police , doctors , and commanders .
she did a rape <unk> , and her <unk> 's blood - from a cut on his arm - was found in her bed .
six months later , in april 0000 , <unk> sat through a hearing before a judge , during which she was questioned about having had sex with her <unk> earlier on the day of the attack .
six people <unk> as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged <unk> , who was eventually acquitted .
" i remember the day when the verdict was read , " <unk> says .
" i thought i was going to go into <unk> - i ran <unk> from the <unk> . "
" they put me into the psychiatric unit , and when i got out , i remember saying to my command officer , " that was n't his trial . that was my trial . " "
<unk> was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist , who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder , rendering her unfit for service .
in january 0000 she was <unk> under less - than - <unk> terms , preventing her from receiving any benefits .
as for whether the case filed by <unk> and her fellow <unk> moves forward , it 's a long shot , says john <unk> , professor of law at george washington university law school .
however , he notes , " in my view they should be able to move forward . "
what stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first issued .
i <unk> been a lifelong critic of the <unk> doctrine .
the military is decades behind because they do n't have the same incentive and deterrent posed by liability .
he adds , " the odds are heavily against them ... but it 's important for them to try . "
these things only change when good people are willing to fight .
if the hearing does n't go their way , <unk> , the <unk> " lawyer , will <unk> up her hundreds of other <unk> for future cases .
" we will continue battling the military on this issue until reform occurs , " she says .
or until we die , whichever comes first .
walls have eyes : how researchers are studying you on <unk>
before he became the new face of right - wing extremism in europe , <unk> <unk> <unk> was just another guy airing his anti - immigration views online .
on monday , <unk> , who admitted to a killing <unk> in norway in july which left 00 people dead , faced his first public court hearing .
while <unk> may have acted alone , he was far from alone in cyberspace : he had spent much of the time leading up to his attack at his computer , <unk> with some of the millions of nationalists who support right - wing groups on social - networking sites .
after this summer 's tragedy , researchers wanted to find out more about these people .
but how to find them ?
easy - just log on to <unk> .
" we <unk> that it was n't that difficult to get to them at all , " says <unk> <unk> , the lead author of a recently published report on european digital populism by british think <unk> demos .
<unk> 's <unk> of personal information is so <unk> , says <unk> , that the researchers could simply use the site 's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic with scientific accuracy - the way <unk> have been doing for years .
<unk> 's team found half a million <unk> of right - wing groups across europe and then targeted them with ads , but instead of linking to a new <unk> or diet product , the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked questions about their education level , attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future .
by reaching out through <unk> , <unk> and his colleagues were able to survey over 00,000 followers of 00 far - right parties in 00 european countries - all without ever leaving the office .
" it 's quite a new way of doing research , " <unk> says .
some of the results are n't all that surprising : online supporters of right - wing groups tend to be young , male , and vexed by immigration .
but in something of a <unk> , " those who combine their online activism with <unk> activism are more reasonable , more democratic and less violent than those who just remain behind the computer screen . "
demos 's work is just one example of how <unk> is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists .
think tanks , medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in ' likes ' , wall posts and status <unk> .
with over 000 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day , the <unk> " data <unk> " is generating a research boom , driving the number of academic papers with the site 's name in the title up almost 000 % over the past five years .
for some researchers , the <unk> of <unk> is that it lets you study people you could n't approach with a <unk> on the street .
" before , when you tried to survey people from the british national party , it would be very difficult to identify them . "
" you <unk> have to go through the party and they would never allow you access , " says <unk> .
" <unk> cuts all that out - you go to them directly . "
others say the site could offer a way to identify and tackle social - health problems .
a recent study by <unk> <unk> moreno of the university of <unk> , <unk> and her colleagues found that <unk> who discussed their <unk> exploits on <unk> were significantly more at risk for problem drinking than students who were silent on the topic .
moreno suggests that students ' peers , such as residential advisors , could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who posts one too many <unk> status <unk> .
" you ca n't treat a problem if you ca n't diagnose it , " <unk> <unk> , moreno 's co - author and director of the <unk> for child health , <unk> and development at the <unk> children 's research institute , told the washington post .
" we <unk> found a way to identify kids at risk who would not otherwise be diagnosed . "
<unk> , too , is constantly <unk> into its own population for data .
the site 's data team has worked up <unk> on relationship status and <unk> 's day , voter turnout in the 0000 <unk> , and a national happiness index ( mainly using information only it can access - champions of digital freedom have long held that the site should make its vast <unk> of data available to others for research . )
but <unk> 's users know the site is watching them , whether they like it or not - the trade off for being able to play <unk> with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information .
but what about when <unk> users become part of a survey they do n't even know about ?
while researchers have well - defined guidelines about how they collect their data <unk> , online it 's a free - for - all .
" i do n't think a lot of users had even thought about the fact that a researcher could be looking at their profiles , " says neil <unk> , a <unk> at the london knowledge <unk> , of a 0000 study he conducted using students ' public <unk> walls .
" as far as they were concerned , it was just between them and their friends . "
then there 's the question of methodology .
even <unk> , there 's no guarantee that a research subject is being completely honest .
on <unk> , it 's impossible to know how much of a user 's profile information and wall posts are true .
" what you say on <unk> and what you do outside of <unk> are two completely different things , " says <unk> .
which is why , despite his years as a technology researcher , <unk> thinks a <unk> and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use .
" there 's no substitute for going into the real world and speaking to real people , " he says .
" social research is supposed to be about the social - and a hell of a lot of the social still takes place <unk> . "
" cold and inhuman " : <unk> <unk> <unk> makes first public court appearance
<unk> <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> to <unk> twin attacks that killed 00 people in norway this summer , has described himself as a " resistance " <unk> during his first public court appearance in oslo .
" i am a military commander in the <unk> resistance movement and <unk> <unk> norway , " he said before a <unk> packed with 000 people .
" i object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports <unk> . "
" i acknowledge the acts but i do not plead guilty . "
judge <unk> <unk> interrupted <unk> during that monologue because he " did not want to give <unk> the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views . "
for the same reason he refused to allow <unk> , who brought a pre - written speech with him , to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing .
<unk> also ordered police to hold <unk> in custody for 00 more weeks , banned him from accessing media for four weeks , and said that authorities will have tight control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks .
around 00 <unk> and victims " relatives attended the hearing .
some came hoping to look <unk> in the eye , others to confirm that he is being held under lock and key .
all attended with the goal of moving toward closure .
" i thought he seemed cold and inhuman , " one <unk> <unk> told <unk> <unk> <unk> .
" it was uncomfortable , but for me i moved on a little bit after seeing and hearing the suspect . "
<unk> in a dark suit and blue tie , <unk> remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and <unk> in the eye as he entered and <unk> the building .
despite <unk> 's bizarre notion of being part of a larger " resistance " movement , the judge determined that he is not <unk> , and said that there is no evidence he acted with accomplices .
it may comfort some that the july 00 attacks seem to be the work of one extremist rather than a group of radicals .
but that does n't automatically ease the <unk> and confusion that an entire nation still feels .
" i wish he looked like a monster , but he does n't , " a relative of one victim said .
" it would be so much easier if he did . "
0 lessons from the lost <unk> jobs interview , showing at a <unk> this week
following the death of <unk> jobs on <unk> 0 , there were some who compared him to henry ford - <unk> out the tech genius as the great modern <unk> .
but what apple <unk> might find most revealing in a recently <unk> jobs interview <unk> off in advance of special <unk> <unk> in major markets this week , is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product <unk> .
he was certainly a <unk> , <unk> and self - identified <unk> , but he was also a <unk> <unk> and flow - <unk> <unk> - a man who believed that many business executives suffered from " a disease of thinking that a really great idea is 00 percent of the work ... [ but ] there 's a tremendous amount of <unk> between a great idea and a great product . "
back in 0000 , <unk> <unk> was developing the tv series triumph of the nerds about the <unk> of the personal computer , and he sat down for more than an hour with jobs for a rare , extended conversation .
at that point in time it had been roughly 00 years since jobs had been forced out of apple , and he was already hard at work at his new computer company next , looking forward to the popular adoption of the internet .
while a small portion of <unk> 's interview was used in nerds , he says that the interview 's master <unk> went missing in shipping .
it was only following jobs " death that a complete <unk> copy was discovered in the director 's <unk> .
this footage , slightly re - <unk> , is the basis of the 00 - minute <unk> jobs : the lost interview , coming to landmark <unk> this wednesday and thursday .
for someone known to loathe in - depth <unk> , jobs seems surprisingly eager here to <unk> on his technological <unk> and business strategies .
and incredibly thoughtful .
at four different points during the interview , there are major gaps between questions and answers - 00 to 00 - second <unk> , where jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts , aiming for precision .
there are also moments where jobs " <unk> rises to the surface , where he seems impatient about <unk> 's questions , <unk> him to move faster towards issues or <unk> of greater import .
<unk> before the era of <unk> , the <unk> or the <unk> , there 's something <unk> <unk> about the lost interview , as jobs assesses what he sees other companies doing right and wrong , and offers his own vision of the future of <unk> .
it 's one thing to read <unk> <unk> of jobs " career , but there 's something raw and inspiring about the jobs we see here , the anxious <unk> on the brink of <unk> .
he has a vision for the way things could be and should be .
not long after <unk> it all out here he went and did it .
a quick <unk> of seven notable lost interview <unk> :
on how he learned to run a business :
" throughout the years in business , i <unk> always ask : " why do you do things ? " and the answers you <unk> get are : " oh , that 's just the way it 's done . " "
nobody knows why they do what they do , nobody thinks about things very deeply in business .
that 's what i found .
jobs goes on to detail his efforts to streamline accounting at apple .
<unk> by the way costs were recorded - often beginning with a " standard cost " that amounted to a blind guess , which was then adjusted with a " variance " - he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine business costs down to the second .
on <unk> the pope :
jobs <unk> the " blue box " that he built with <unk> <unk> - a device that allowed people to effectively <unk> the phone company and make long distance calls for free .
the device has been widely written about before , but jobs " euphoria here in describing the blue box as an act of <unk> is infectious .
he describes how he and <unk> would test the box by using a pay phone , placing a call , and then connecting from one <unk> network to another while <unk> in as many <unk> as possible .
" we were <unk> things around the globe a half dozen times and you would <unk> through the pay phone and it would come through a minute later in the pay phone next door , " jobs says with a <unk> .
" we were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world . "
us two , we did n't know much , but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson , and i do n't think there would have ever been apple without it .
jobs goes on to detail one <unk> <unk> that he and <unk> nearly pulled of , <unk> the vatican via the blue box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the pope , while doing their very best impression of henry kissinger .
as various members of the catholic hierarchy were <unk> in the middle of the night to talk to the american diplomat , the two burst into <unk> just before the pope himself was <unk> to come answer the phone .
on falling in love with technology ( and cold - calling bill <unk> ) :
at the age of 00 , on the hunt for spare parts to build a frequency counter , he looked up bill <unk> in the phone book and gave him a call .
not long after their 00 - minute phone conversation , jobs landed a part - time summer job at <unk> - <unk> .
" that made a remarkable influence on me , it was the only company i had seen at that age and it formed my view of what a company was and how well they treated their employees . "
jobs later became one of the <unk> employees to visit the company 's <unk> <unk> research <unk> , where he saw " the first <unk> computer ever made . "
it was as big as a <unk> , had a small <unk> <unk> <unk> display , and i fell in love with it .
i would get a ride up to <unk> as a <unk> and <unk> around that machine and write <unk> for it .
on <unk> innovation :
at several points in the interview , jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly .
early in his career , as he set out to sell a handful of <unk> boards , he was asked by a customer to assemble the full computer .
working on only 00 days of credit , he had to figure out both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices .
later while at apple , he recalls the <unk> he faced in developing a computer <unk> :
" i remember having dramatic arguments ... they were <unk> at me that it would take five years [ to build a <unk> that would cost <unk> 000 ] , and i got fed up and went outside and found a <unk> . "
ninety days later , we had a <unk> we could build for <unk> 00 that was incredibly reliable .
on great companies losing steam :
long before he led the revival of apple , jobs <unk> <unk> the ways in which so many industry leaders would stumble in their vision , and lose control of their market share .
" say you work at <unk> or <unk> , so you make a better <unk> or <unk> , so what ? "
you have a monopoly of the market share , so the company 's not more successful .
sales and marketing makes it more successful , so [ it 's those kinds of people ] who end up running companies and the product people get driven out of the decision - making forum .
the product genius that led to that monopolistic position is <unk> out by people who have no conception of good products vs. bad products - the <unk> required .
that 's what happened at <unk> ...
<unk> could have owned the entire computer industry .
it could have been ten times its size , could have been the microsoft of the 00s ...
they <unk> defeat from victory .
on innovation as art form :
" there 's a tremendous amount of <unk> between a great idea and a great product ... as you evolve that great idea , it changes and grows . "
you learn a lot about the <unk> of it .
there are <unk> you have to make - certain things you ca n't make <unk> do , glass do , <unk> do , factories do .
you have to keep 0,000 things in your brain - these concepts - fitting them all together ...
ultimately it comes down to taste - it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best stuff humans have done , and then trying to bring those things in to what you <unk> doing .
<unk> said that good artists copy , great artists steal .
we <unk> always been shameless about stealing great ideas .
it 's part of what made the <unk> great , was that the people who were working on it were <unk> , <unk> , artists , <unk> , historians who just happened to be the best computer scientists in the world .
if not for computer science , they would be doing amazing things in other fields .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> with healthcare law <unk> as court takes case
the day the supreme court gathered behind closed doors to consider the politically divisive question of whether it would hear a challenge to president <unk> 's healthcare law , two of its <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , were <unk> at a <unk> sponsored by the law firm that will argue the case before the high court .
the occasion was last thursday , when all nine <unk> met for a conference to <unk> over the petitions for review .
one of the cases at issue was a suit brought by 00 states challenging the sweeping healthcare overhaul passed by congress last year , a law that has been a <unk> cry for conservative activists <unk> .
the <unk> agreed to hear the suit ; indeed , a landmark 0 0/0 - hour argument is expected in march , and the outcome is likely to further <unk> the 0000 presidential race , which will be in full <unk> by the time the court 's decision is released .
the lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the law should be thrown out is likely to be paul <unk> , who served as <unk> <unk> general during the george <unk> bush administration .
<unk> 's law firm , <unk> <unk> , was one of almost two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual <unk> of the federalist society , a longstanding group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles .
another firm that sponsored the <unk> , <unk> day , represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law , the national federation of independent business .
another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant <unk> <unk> , which has an enormous financial stake in the outcome of the litigation .
the <unk> was held at a washington hotel hours after the court 's conference over the case .
in attendance was , among others , <unk> <unk> , the senate 's top republican and an <unk> opponent of the healthcare law .
the <unk> guests at the <unk> ? <unk> and <unk> .
it 's nothing new : the two <unk> have been attending federalist society events for years .
and it 's nothing that runs <unk> of ethics rules .
in fact , <unk> are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of lower federal <unk> .
if they were , they arguably fell under code 's <unk> <unk> , which states , " a judge may attend fund - raising events of law - related and other organizations although the judge may not be a speaker , a guest of <unk> , or <unk> on the program of such an event . "
nevertheless , the sheer proximity of <unk> and <unk> to two of the law firms in the case , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest , was enough to alarm ethics - in - government activists .
" this <unk> breach of ethics and indifference to the code <unk> claims by several <unk> that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges , " said <unk> <unk> , the president of common cause .
" the <unk> were <unk> and <unk> at a black - tie <unk> with <unk> who have pending cases before the court . "
their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event <unk> any claims of impartiality , and is unacceptable .
<unk> and <unk> have shown little regard for critics who say they too readily mix the business of the court with agenda - driven groups such as the federalist society .
and <unk> " wife , <unk> , is a high - profile conservative activist .
moreover , conservatives argue that it 's justice elena <unk> who has an ethical issue , not <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> served as <unk> general in the <unk> administration when the first legal challenges to the law were brought at the trial court level .
her critics have pushed for <unk> to <unk> herself from hearing the case , saying that she was too invested in defending the law then to be impartial now .
<unk> has given no indication she will do so .
boeing gets record <unk> 00 - billion <unk> order
<unk> airline orders 00 twin - <unk> boeing 000 <unk> with an option for 00 more .
boeing also <unk> six boeing <unk> to <unk> air , a deal worth more than <unk> 0 billion .
it 's rarely news when a company gets an order for 00 units of its product .
but it 's a big deal when the company is airplane - maker boeing <unk> and the list price for those 00 <unk> <unk> a record <unk> 00 billion .
just as big is where boeing got the order : the middle east , a growing gold mine of future airplane orders .
in a forecast released monday , the chicago company estimates that airlines in the middle east over the next 00 years will need 0,000 <unk> worth <unk> 000 billion .
boeing over the weekend announced its biggest - ever order by dollar value for commercial <unk> - 00 twin - <unk> boeing 000 jets .
the blockbuster order came from <unk> airline in <unk> .
the airline also has an option to buy 00 more planes , which would push the total list price to <unk> 00 billion , boeing announced at the 0000 <unk> air show .
then on monday , boeing said <unk> air ordered six boeing <unk> , the so - called <unk> , which boasts dramatically better fuel economy and passenger <unk> .
list price for six of those is more than <unk> 0 billion .
" this is clearly a huge positive for boeing , " <unk> analyst <unk> <unk> said .
" the quality of these particular customers is pretty strong . "
many middle east airlines are owned by their oil - producing nations .
so , not only do they have the money to pay for planes , but a surge in fuel prices - usually damaging to airlines because it 's one of their biggest costs - is not as detrimental because the country is making money on the higher price of oil .
that 's important because they will be less likely than other airlines to <unk> or delay airplane orders when fuel prices rise , <unk> said .
" they have a natural hedge , " he said .
the <unk> order <unk> boeing 's lead in the market for wide - body planes and helps hold at <unk> competitor airbus sas ' attempt to <unk> on its <unk> with the a 000 <unk> .
boeing 's win at the air show comes four months after airbus said it would push back the <unk> of the largest a 000 , which competes directly with the <unk> .
it delayed the <unk> to add more thrust after customers demanded more <unk> and range .
boeing co shares rose 0.0 % to <unk> 00.00 .
mexico president 's <unk> apparently defeated in <unk> vote
<unk> maria <unk> <unk> that drug traffickers helped opponent fausto <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> 's race .
president <unk> <unk> 's <unk> appears to have lost her bid for <unk> of <unk> during violent state elections , and she alleged monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in <unk> of one of her opponents .
preliminary results gave the lead in the race for <unk> of the western state to fausto <unk> of the institutional revolutionary party , or <unk> .
" the intervention by <unk> crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming , not just for <unk> but for the entire country , " <unk> maria <unk> said in a radio interview a day after sunday 's vote .
" they threatened our candidates , our poll workers <unk> they seized ballot boxes , set up roadblocks ... and ordered people to vote " for the <unk> .
the <unk> ruled mexico for seven decades until losing the presidency in 0000 .
but it is <unk> a comeback , and victory in <unk> is an important step in that effort .
the <unk> is hoping to win the presidential election in july .
<unk> appears to have only narrowly edged out <unk> , who had led polls before election day .
<unk> , a candidate for her brother 's conservative national action party , or pan , refused to <unk> <unk> as the winner .
<unk> <unk> , the candidate for the <unk> democratic revolution party , or <unk> , which currently holds the <unk> , came in third , a bad defeat for the divided and <unk> left ahead of the 0000 presidential vote .
<unk> also refused to <unk> the preliminary results .
<unk> , former mayor of the state capital of <unk> , denied ties to drug traffickers and urged the other candidates to accept the results .
<unk> has long been dominated by drug cartels <unk> in <unk> , heroin and <unk> .
it is president <unk> 's home state , and he chose <unk> to launch a military - led offensive against traffickers in december 0000 .
yet violence has persisted .
a pan mayor was <unk> a week before the election as he campaigned for <unk> maria <unk> , and numerous candidates quit local <unk> out of fear .
for the <unk> , though , however nasty the <unk> election looks , a win will help the party 's momentum .
the man expected to represent the <unk> in the presidential race , enrique <unk> <unk> , speaking from washington , congratulated <unk> and said , " i think this victory should be very encouraging , looking ahead to next year . "
<unk> urges asia to help rescue eurozone
the asian development bank has called for india and china to be ready to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long - term <unk> that will <unk> the growth of asian economies .
<unk> <unk> , the managing director of the <unk> - based <unk> , said the world 's two fastest - growing large economies had to " do all they can " to speed the recovery of the the currency bloc either through the international monetary fund or direct bilateral arrangements .
he warned against bric [ brazil , russia , india , china ] countries looking at europe 's difficulties in a " <unk> way " and said that asian financial assistance alongside european leadership and resources would help avoid a long - term breakdown in the global economy .
" we are all in this together . "
" so anybody who can help europe get out of the crisis is useful , " he told the financial times in an interview on the sidelines of the world economic forum in <unk> .
" asia may be <unk> to some extent but it cannot be immune . "
" so if china and india can help , by all means . "
europe 's monetary union has been badly undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in past months .
in recent days , italy 's borrowing costs have <unk> dangerously and the prime ministers of both italy and greece have resigned .
the unfolding sovereign debt crisis in europe has raised fears that it could push the global economy back into recession and prompted calls for leading emerging economies to <unk> together to help the eurozone find a solution .
mr <unk> predicted that any asian support would be channelled through the <unk> , but said bilateral assistance <unk> like buying the <unk> of the eu 's bail - out fund , the european financial stability facility <unk> offered greater bargaining power to europe 's asian partners .
<unk> <unk> , india 's minister of trade , said that " india will do whatever it can " to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering falling exports and a drying up of foreign capital <unk> .
" nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent , " he said .
" we have monumental challenges and we have to sustain a high level of growth . "
" it is not an option , it is an imperative , because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women . "
others argue that developing economies like india have no business helping wealthy europeans when they face their own profound economic challenges .
<unk> <unk> , a professor at brown university in the us , said it would be politically very difficult to sell assistance to europe to india 's 0. <unk> people , of whom as many as <unk> live on about <unk> 0 a day or less .
" <unk> they will find out that greeks retire at the age of 00 and go on holiday to beaches and it wo n't go down well , " he said .
lee <unk> , the managing director of the world economic forum , likewise questioned why india 's reserves should be used to keep greece 's numerous and well - paid public sector workers in jobs in poorly managed , loss - making utilities like the railways .
mr <unk> said that the eurozone crisis threatened " significant knock - on effects " across asia .
the <unk> 's forecast of 0.0 per cent economic growth in asia for 0000/00 now faced " risks on the <unk> " because of the threat from europe .
he said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make " contingency plans " to protect themselves from a <unk> and significant capital <unk> from their economies .
dire warnings from <unk> over potential <unk> cuts
<unk> secretary <unk> <unk> turned up the heat on congress monday , warning that looming automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and set off a financial chain reaction from the <unk> of the <unk> , to the battlefields of afghanistan , to civilian assembly lines .
the <unk> already is <unk> <unk> 000 billion of reductions over the next decade but now fears an additional <unk> 000 billion or more in cuts may be imminent if congress cannot reach a deal on spending .
" the impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the department , " <unk> said in a letter to <unk> . john <unk> , <unk> - <unk> , and <unk> graham , <unk> - south <unk> .
he said that <unk> failure to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so - called sequestration would trigger 00 % across - the - board reductions and a halt to many new projects .
" such a large cut , applied in this indiscriminate manner , would render most of our ship and construction projects <unk> <unk> you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building <unk> and seriously damage other <unk> efforts , " <unk> wrote to the senators .
" we would also be forced to separate many of our civilian personnel <unk> and , because the reduction would be imposed so quickly , we would almost certainly have to <unk> civilians in order to meet the target . "
" these changes would break faith with those who maintain our military and seriously damage readiness . "
the cuts would eventually hit combat troops , <unk> said .
" while <unk> funding in the overseas contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by the <unk> , war efforts would be adversely affected by the severe disruption in the base budgets , " <unk> warned .
" contracting personnel would be cut , resulting in delays in the contracts and the contract oversight that support the war . "
" payroll personnel would be cut , resulting in late payments to <unk> <unk> , and legal and policy support would be <unk> . "
the two senators had written <unk> 00 days ago , asking for details of the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the <unk> department .
" the consequence of a <unk> on the <unk> department would set off a swift decline of the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" we are staunchly opposed to this draconian action , " the senators said in a joint statement monday afternoon when they released <unk> 's letter .
" this is not an outcome that we can live with , and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves . "
" the <unk> is a threat to the national security interests of the united states , and it should not be allowed to occur . "
whether the <unk> letter and the fresh warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or step up calls to exempt the <unk> from cuts remains to be seen .
<unk> has been increasingly <unk> about the possible cuts , although he came to the top <unk> job with years of budget expertise himself in congress and the white house and knowing that he was facing tough choices .
at a news conference last week , the secretary of <unk> painted a bleak picture of what could lie ahead <unk> a military with a shell but no core .
" it 's a ship without sailors . "
" it 's a <unk> without bullets . "
" it 's an air wing without enough trained pilots . "
" it 's a paper tiger , an army of <unk> , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " <unk> said in his opening remarks at the <unk> .
" it 's a force that suffers low <unk> , poor readiness and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries . "
" in effect , it invites aggression .. "
in an <unk> to his letters to <unk> and graham , <unk> spelled out new specifics of how reductions " generate significant operational risks : delay response time to crises , conflicts , and disasters ; severely limits our ability to be forward deployed and engaged around the world ; and assumes unacceptable risk in future combat operations . "
and <unk> said that some of the biggest <unk> projects could face the <unk> , including those already being tested and some just in early stages of planning .
that list included the f 00 joint strike <unk> , a planned new bomber , the next - generation <unk> <unk> , the new <unk> combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle the army and <unk> need to replace the <unk> .
halting further development and testing the f 00 could generate some <unk> 00 billion in savings over 00 years but its supporters say it is a vital next step to upgrade and meet potential threats from china and other <unk> .
how to spot a lie
a glance at recent headlines indicates just how serious and <unk> deceit and lying are in daily life .
republican presidential candidate <unk> <unk> is busy trading allegations of sexual harassment with several women ; each side <unk> the other of lying .
administrators at <unk> state have been charged with <unk> for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football <unk> was sexually <unk> boys .
last week french president nicolas sarkozy was caught on an open <unk> asserting to <unk> president <unk> <unk> that israeli prime minister <unk> <unk> is a <unk> .
lying has destroyed careers and <unk> countries .
new york congressman and internet <unk> <unk> <unk> made a fool of himself issuing <unk> quickly <unk> by incontrovertible evidence .
former presidential candidate john <unk> has been charged with campaign finance violations connected to the cover - up of an <unk> affair .
and then again , no one who lived through it will ever forget the media circus president bill clinton unleashed by lying during his second term in office about his sexual involvement with <unk> <unk> .
tales of <unk> on school and college tests are rife .
there have been instances where teachers have given students test answers in order to make themselves look good on their performance reviews .
<unk> who should be teaching the opposite are sending a message that lying and <unk> are acceptable .
how much deceit do we encounter ?
on a given day , studies show , you may be <unk> to anywhere from 00 to 000 times .
now granted , many of those are white lies .
another study showed that strangers <unk> three times within the first 00 minutes of meeting each other .
<unk> lies , or " lie <unk> , " is an essential skill for everyone to acquire , for both personal and professional reasons .
far from being a <unk> game similar to , say , <unk> , where the object is to <unk> , " <unk> , " deception detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades at <unk> universities conducting in - depth research projects , especially in psychology and <unk> .
one result of the research is that most old myths about lying have been <unk> .
<unk> do look you in the eye .
they do not always <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
do n't conclude from this that <unk> are hard to spot and difficult to <unk> .
a trained lie <unk> can get to the truth by learning about statement structure , facial <unk> - expressions , question formation and timing .
i spent several years <unk> the scientific findings in the vast and ever emerging body of knowledge on deception , and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helpful in navigating our complex world <unk> especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring , <unk> , negotiating or managing .
good <unk> are skilled at reading others well , putting them at ease , managing their own emotions and <unk> <unk> how others perceive them .
we know from research that <unk> lie more than <unk> , that men tell more " self - oriented " lies while women tell more " other - oriented " lies <unk> usually to protect someone 's feelings <unk> that <unk> people lie less frequently to their partners than <unk> people do ( but the lies they do tell tend to be " <unk> " ) .
we also know that if you are perceived as a <unk> , others will feel less guilt in lying to you .
how do you tell if someone is lying ?
first , observe your subject 's normal <unk> .
this is called " <unk> . "
it helps provide a reference point for measuring changes later .
observe your subject 's <unk> , laugh , <unk> quality .
you <unk> better know if someone normally <unk> their foot all the time so you do n't make unjust accusations when you see foot - <unk> in the middle of the meeting .
then look for clusters of <unk> verbal and <unk> <unk> .
consider these clusters red flags , not proof of deception .
<unk> people might freeze their upper body when trying to remember their story , they might point their feet toward the door , <unk> toward an exit , shift their <unk> in significant ways or <unk> " post - interview relief " <unk> that exaggerated <unk> of relief and shift in <unk> when all the hard questions are over .
<unk> often falsely signal that an interview is over just to look for that post - interview relief .
also , pay attention to your subject 's language .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and used the past tense while claiming his murdered wife was alive , launching a <unk> search for her .
<unk> individuals might also use distancing language : " i did not have sexual relations with that woman ... miss <unk> " or repeat a hard question in its entirety .
the most common verbal indicators are <unk> .
someone might use lots of " qualifying language " when answering a hard question : " well ... to tell you the truth ... as far as i know ... to the best of my knowledge . "
this renders the answer perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag .
there 's no magic bullet for <unk> lies , but developing skills to <unk> out deception is possible .
these skills will enhance anyone 's chances of avoiding <unk> by <unk> artists in their professional and personal lives .
controversial oil pipeline plan to be <unk> after threat of delayed <unk> approval
days after the <unk> administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from canada to the gulf of mexico <unk> <unk> unions while <unk> environmentalists <unk> the company seeking to build the pipeline says it 's willing to <unk> the project to get it back on track .
<unk> said monday evening it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive <unk> area of <unk> , and is confident the project will still win approval .
the company announced the decision at a news conference at the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> official <unk> <unk> says the company remains confident it will eventually get a pipeline approved , albeit with a different route .
that comes after the state department 's announcement last week that it would delay a decision on a federal permit for the project until it studies new potential routes that avoid the <unk> areas of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , a vast underground water supply .
" this is a real path forward , " <unk> lee terry , a republican from <unk> , told fox news .
the new environmental review ordered by the state department likely would push off any decision until 0000 , after next year 's elections , though officials denied that politics was involved in the decision .
<unk> , in a written statement last week , described the decision as the state department 's call , and expressed support for it .
the 0,000 - mile pipeline would extend from canada to the gulf of mexico .
it would carry 000,000 <unk> per day from the province of <unk> to refineries in texas .
to do so would require it crossing six states .
it is hated by environmentalists but loved by <unk> groups , who have <unk> on the estimated 00,000 jobs tied to the pipeline .
but <unk> lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the sand hills region and <unk> <unk> , a major source of drinking water and irrigation .
the state department 's current environmental impact study found the project would pose only limited adverse environmental impacts , but the energy industry source said the department 's inspector general has ordered a separate probe of the review process , <unk> on two questions .
one is whether a lobbyist <unk> by <unk> , paul <unk> , who was a campaign adviser to <unk> clinton in 0000 , represents a conflict of interest for the program .
the other is whether a firm that was <unk> to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was tied to <unk> .

she had a bottle of water and started <unk> water from the bottle on me .
she said <unk> got <unk> .
" i said to this woman , " look what you <unk> done to my daughter , " " the child 's mother said .

later , the family sent a note asking for an apology from <unk> but got no response .

the suit seeks <unk> damages , but the family 's lawyer , <unk> <unk> , said he took the case for free and that the family plans to <unk> any money it gets to a children 's cancer charity .
" the purpose is to hold <unk> <unk> responsible for her conduct , " <unk> said .
" that kind of <unk> is completely unacceptable , especially when aimed at a <unk> teacher carrying an 00 - month - old child . "
the climatic <unk> slowed down the economy
during the first year of mario <unk> <unk> management , in <unk> increased the unemployment and the <unk> , foreign investment declined and the economy was reduced .
0000 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of <unk> , being related to the first year of mario <unk> <unk> government also called the year of change , which generated great expectations as regards the development of the economy , but given the climatic <unk> of the beginning of the year , there was no growth , however there was registered a decline in the main indicators of economic development .
the low february temperatures , not only did they cause losses of millions for the agricultural sector , but they limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow , causing a contraction of the economic activity in general of 0.0 percent in the first half of the year , mainly supported by the historic fall of 00.00 per cent in agriculture , which affected the dynamics of other economic sectors .
according to the report regarding the areas affected by the frost , issued by the mexican council for sustainable rural development there were damaged <unk> hectares , out of which 00.00 percent suffered total damage and the remaining of 00.00 percent had partial damage . the main damaged crops were the vegetables , corn and <unk> .
the fall in the economic activity has generated , until november , a constant increase of the unemployment in the state , according to the national institute of statistics and geography , the unemployment state rate during the first three quarters of the year registered an accelerated growth , from january to march <unk> <unk> <unk> were unemployed , with a rate of 0.00 percent of the economically active population for the second quarter , the rate became 0.00 percent , and between july and september the average continued to increase to 0.00 percent , a rate that in terms of the number of people represents more than <unk> of unemployed <unk> <unk> , an increase compared to the first half of <unk> individuals .
lower liquidity
unemployment in <unk> during the year is multi - <unk> , for the economist gerardo <unk> <unk> , director at the <unk> of economics and social sciences of the <unk> , the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly , depending on the actions that the public policy has been taken .
" what we <unk> seeing now is an increase of the unemployment that has to do with several factors , including the loss of liquidity in the market for the purpose of a resource constraint imposed by the legislation that passed in the congress in order to combat money laundering since for the people who illegally possess dollars is not easy work with , invest and use them in something " he said .
stopped immigration
<unk> <unk> said that in the increase of unemployment there is also a demographic factor .
" the number of people who leaves the state in search of a job abroad , in the united states has been restricted , first of all due to the difficulties to enter , and second of all because once they enter they already have too many difficulties in finding a job , that group of people is staying and demanding jobs here , in the state , causing the rate of unemployment to rise , " he said .
<unk>
the <unk> market analysis of <unk> gets worse when considering the high level of <unk> that prevails among the working conditions , according to <unk> , 00.00 percent of the active population in the state works without being quoted as workers to any social security institution .
in addition to the unemployment and <unk> , another state <unk> reminder is represented by low wages ; the entity has the lowest wages in the country , according to the records of the mexican social security institute and the ministry of <unk> and social welfare .
the monthly average income of <unk> workers was , until september , 0.000 <unk> , well below the national average , that is of 0.000 <unk> .

for its part , the ministry of economic development of the state government accounted a total investment of <unk> <unk> during the year , which occurred mainly in tertiary sector companies .
debt
against the backdrop of economic <unk> , the state government asked in july during the state congress , the approval of a credit of 0 billion <unk> , which would be for the investment in infrastructure projects in 00 municipalities , in order to <unk> the economy , the local <unk> approval was for a total of 0.000 million <unk> , and until november no benefits of the debt were observed in any sector of the state economy .
reactions
for business representatives , the first year of mario <unk> <unk> government demonstrates a lack of capacity of the government .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , president of the national chamber of transformation industry , said that during 0000 there was a lack of <unk> of the <unk> of various sectors , including the state government itself .
" the performance of the economy in <unk> this year has been really poor , one has to work hard in order to regain the ground lost this year , in 0000 we must redouble our efforts , we failed to align the efforts of all and above all the good and <unk> motion of the new government team , we hope that next year will be much better " he said .
economic slowness
<unk> <unk> said that the events such as early frost this year stopped the state economy and its performance and growth were restricted .
" the low economic flow is the product of several events , including frost , one of the main effects has been a slow economy which does not turn fast enough for generating an economic dynamism that allows having an acceptable flow level of the processes , products and services and therefore , at the end of the year we are closing it below our expectations , " he said .
redefining the vocation
<unk> <unk> <unk> , president of the employers " confederation of the mexican republic in <unk> , said that the state is required to prosecute the most dynamic productive activities .
" overall , we found that there has been working on , we believe it is necessary to develop a long term program that redefines the vocation and the economic course of the state , it is important to <unk> all the material and human potential resource that <unk> has , " he said .
work to do
<unk> president stressed the importance of establishing a future vision to guide better the efforts of the government .
" overall i would say that the government has been striving to be successful in various fields , in terms of economic development there is some progress but it is important to develop a long - term program , " he said .
he noted that the current administration has shown progress in its own manner of leading the public policy .
" there are elements that allow us saying that the government is becoming more inclusive , and what i can say is that there is work done and i think the government is aware that there is work to do , " he said .
they condemn him for 0 kilograms of <unk>
five years in prison and a fine of 000 days was the sentence given to a <unk> citizen for the possession of eight <unk> of <unk> .
the general <unk> office reported that the sentenced drug <unk> is omar <unk> <unk> <unk> , for the crime against health , in its variant of possession of <unk> for purposes of trade .

there must be made contributions to works
the social works referred to in the <unk> such as <unk> , rescue of public spaces and <unk> for migrants risk not to be completed or to have serious delays due to the lack of funds , said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the director of municipal social development indicated that although so far the work <unk> have advanced they are at risk because the state government failed to make the contributions that correspond , which represent a resource superior to 00 million <unk> in all three <unk> .
he noted that the total investment in these three <unk> is of nearly 00 million <unk> , of which the state has to contribute with 00 percent and so far only the federation and the municipality have provided resources for the works , so the possible delay in the completion of these is in force .
" they have to contribute with almost 00 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a <unk> , since starting with july they had to give us a part , " he said , " in order not to delay we have started the works and they are very advanced , but we need the money . "
he mentioned that last year , during the administration of <unk> aguilar <unk> , the state did not comply with the contributions it had to make , so that at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to borrow money in order to cover more than 0 million , a sum that was not provided on that occasion by the state administration .
" it happened to us in the previous administration because the state did not have the financial capacity to participate and the <unk> continued advancing , and this year in order to access these <unk> we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending , " he explained .
although there is a commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources , he said that the request was made <unk> the secretary of administration and finance , <unk> <unk> , to speed up the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them to come as quickly as possible .
" they have to contribute with almost 00 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a <unk> . "
the court <unk> " digital television transition " in mexico in 0000
the replacement of <unk> with digital is one of the most important changes that has hit the world in recent years
the supreme court of justice ( <unk> ) rejected the constitutional <unk> brought by the senate and house of representatives against the presidential decree that brings forward the so - called " digital television transition " from 0000 to 0000 , since the eight votes needed to invalidate it were not obtained .
a minority of four ministers , including the president of the court , <unk> silva <unk> , considered that president <unk> <unk> did not exceed his authority by issuing a decree detailing the actions to take in order to achieve the transition to the digital terrestrial television .
with this result , the constitutional controversy promoted by the senate , was rejected for not meeting the qualified majority of eight votes for the court to pronounce on the constitutionality or <unk> of the decree , and this remains in force .
the sentence project prepared by the minister <unk> sánchez <unk> , proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree , because the regulation of radio and television materials is a power reserved by law to the federal telecommunications commission ( <unk> ) , in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reserve .
only <unk> , <unk> mario <unk> , <unk> <unk> and sánchez <unk> voted for the project .
with this argument , both the senate and the chamber of <unk> promoted two constitutional <unk> to contradict the decree , and to support the claims , the minister sánchez <unk> suspended the application of the decree and all actions stipulated there regarding the digital transition .
at the ministers " meeting there was also decided to reject the claim filed by the chamber of <unk> , without entering into the discussion of the project , also in charge of the minister sánchez <unk> .
in his speech , the minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to get prepared .
" nor do i consider that if made would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body , " and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive , who has a constitutional mandate , the guidance of the state .
the replacement of <unk> to digital is one of the most important changes that have hit the world in recent years , and results in a better <unk> of the radio - electric spectrum , better signal quality and more channels .
delaying the change , he said , would mean delaying the benefits of <unk> , which involves a public interest decision , which has not only a technical dimension , " as it covers economic , social , political and national security issues . "
these issues , he said , " require the operation of the entire system established under the principle of the state economic <unk> , comprises a group of powers which the constitution leads to the state executive power . "
he recalled that a large number of countries around the world has now completed the digital transition , and has done it through the executive , despite of having highly <unk> technical bodies .
there cannot be concluded that the government , by issuing the <unk> decree , that <unk> in any way the competence of the congress , is providing in the administrative area the observation of the laws issued by the legislature , he said .
they <unk> the possibility of a " vote by vote " count in <unk>
according to the data transmitted by the <unk> the difference between the first and second place in the <unk> election is of only 00 percent , even without counting the votes corresponding to 000 of the total of 0.000 minutes .
the possibility of counting " vote by vote " is a reality as regards the electoral process of this year in <unk> , where according to the data obtained from the preliminary electoral results program ( <unk> ) the difference between the first and the second place of the <unk> 's election is of only 00 percent , even without counting the votes that correspond to 000 of the total 0.000 minutes .
in this regard , the president of the general council of <unk> electoral institute ( <unk> ) , maria de los angeles <unk> zaragoza , recalled that a few days ago , the last november 0th , the electoral body approved a set of guidelines in order to <unk> the local regulations with the electoral federal reform .
as it will be recalled , <unk> did not <unk> the constitution or the electoral code of the state or the electoral justice act , since the congress of the state approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to come into force in this electoral process and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> omitted its publication within the periods specified in the law in the state official <unk> , arguing that he had some objections .
the same november 0th , the supreme court of justice ( <unk> ) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislature and described as " invalid and illegal " the vote of the state representative for the constitutional reforms , since he has no right " to sanction or vote them . "
interviewed about the possibility of the " vote by vote , " maria de los angeles <unk> stated that with the adoption of the appropriate guidelines by the general council of the <unk> it will be possible to perform partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body .
thus , the partial <unk> of one or more electoral boxes may occur in the assumptions that : the results of the records do not match ; there is no record of the count on the record of the box or they are not included in the power of the president ; or when there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes .
in addition , the total count of the vote received in all boxes of the election may take place when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the election in question and the one who has obtained the second place in the voting , is equal to or less than one percentage point , as long as at the beginning of the session there is a request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that nominated the second of the mentioned candidates .
the total vote count will also be done if at the end of the ordinary calculation is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate placed on second position is equal to or less than one percentage point , as long as there is a request of the representative of the political party whose candidate came on the second position , case in which there will be excluded the electoral boxes that have been considered during the partial <unk> .
there should be noted that in this situation is the election of <unk> , where according to <unk> the difference between the first and the second place is of just 0.00 percent , even without counting the votes of 000 of the 000 total minutes .

wednesday there will be formed the new italian government
the appointed prime minister , mario <unk> , will meet tomorrow with the president of italy in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put the country on the edge of an economic disaster
the designated italian prime minister , mario <unk> , will meet wednesday with the president of italy in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put italy on the edge of an economic disaster and has endangered the entire euro zone .
a statement from the presidential palace announced that <unk> , named on sunday , will meet on wednesday with the president , <unk> <unk> , to confirm that he can form a government .
he is expected to present a cabinet composed largely of <unk> , although it is unclear when the new executive will undertake the position .
<unk> said the he will present to the president the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government .
" i want to confirm my complete confidence in the ability of our country of getting out of this difficult phase , " said the former european commissioner to the reporters .
<unk> did not say explicitly that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome .
the " framework is now well <unk> , " he said .
<unk> has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days , much less than the normal , while italy fought a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels .
the new administration led by the former european commissioner <unk> must approve a tough austerity package demanded by the european leaders in order to regain the confidence in italy .
underlying the pressure on <unk> to <unk> , the <unk> markets put the yield of the italian <unk> <unk> to 00 - year above 0 percent , the level at which greece and ireland were forced to be rescued .
<unk> <unk> , leader of the italian employers ' federation told the reporters after meeting with <unk> : " we said we would support very much this government . "
we believe that this government is the last chance for italy to get out of this emergency situation .
<unk> 's chances of success were considerably boosted by the support of the <unk> party of <unk> <unk> , who was forced to resign on saturday due to the crisis .
" we believe that the efforts of professor <unk> are destined to have a good outcome , " said to the reporters <unk> <unk> , secretary of the <unk> - right party .
the support of the <unk> , the largest party in italy , is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the government majority made of <unk> that <unk> is forming .
parliamentary support
<unk> 's new government must have a strong parliamentary support for applying the reforms that are likely to be <unk> austerity reforms .
any <unk> or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets .
the italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of <unk> would be a disaster .
<unk> began on monday his consultations with the political parties , unions and business groups , as well as with youth and women organizations .
he will end his meeting on tuesday night .
<unk> was appointed on sunday by <unk> , who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis .
after a brief rest at the end of last week , when it became clear that <unk> would resign , the italian debt costs have now reached critical levels between uncertainties about whether the new prime minister will succeed .
rescuing italy with a public debt of 0.0 billion euros would be too much for the current financial <unk> of the euro zone .
<unk> has said that his government would last until the next elections scheduled for 0000 , despite the widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms before moving forward with the elections .
<unk> said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet , but the major parties insist that it must be made only of <unk> , an indication of his objections to a process forced by the financial pressure .
political sources said that the mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures .
the <unk> of the spanish is higher than that of the <unk>
of the 00 players called in spain , ten passed 00 international games .
on the side of costa rica only one of 00 called players reached 00 games .
a minor contrast to costa rica , comparing the 00 players called by both countries for the friendly game today , at <unk> <unk> at the national stadium in san jose .
while the world and europe champions , number one in the monthly top of fifa , have a long record of class a inter selection , the <unk> has only the defender michael <unk> as the only one who has 00 international games .
that number was reached friday before the game against panama ( 0-0 ) , in <unk> <unk> .
spanish football players playing in the all - star league and in powerful clubs of the premier league of england are during the year very active in league and local cup competitions and there are high - level shocks in the european <unk> and champions league .
to this is added the spanish fury experience in complicated qualifications for euro and world cup .
the <unk> players , however , have a limited international experience in an area such as <unk> , which is considered the lowest level within fifa
we see that the peak of the spanish selection is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , who last saturday against england ( game lost with 0-0 in london ) <unk> the record of the ex <unk> <unk> <unk> , with 000 international <unk> .
<unk> will play today against the <unk> and will impose a new record of 000 international <unk> for spain .
<unk> <unk> , the player of barcelona , has 000 <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> were recognized last week by uefa together with the other player of the <unk> team , <unk> with 000 <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with 000 .

on costa <unk> side , and close to michael <unk> , are the left - lateral <unk> <unk> , with 00 <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , with 00 .
after this , only five exceeded the 00 games : <unk> <unk> with 00 , <unk> <unk> with 00 , michael <unk> with 00 , carlos <unk> with 00 and jose luis <unk> with 00 .
the least .
more than 00 <unk> in spain have <unk> <unk> ( 00 ) , sergio <unk> ( 00 ) , santiago <unk> <unk> ( 00 ) , <unk> <unk> ( 00 ) and <unk> <unk> ( 00 ) .
on the national side , with less than 00 <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> with 00 , winston parks with 00 , <unk> <unk> with 00 and <unk> <unk> with 00 .
the rest does n't come near the 00 .
while <unk> <unk> has only four games and <unk> alba two , in costa rica victor <unk> has only one <unk> <unk> and nelson <unk> did not <unk> yet .
the leading <unk> of spain is david <unk> is , with 00 goals , followed by fernando <unk> with 00 .

<unk> included the country on the tour for celebrating two decades of experience
' going to costa rica is a dream come true '
in an exclusive interview with <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , of <unk> <unk> , said the <unk> is ready to offer one of its best <unk> next sunday at the national stadium .
there were more than 00 years of wait , but the <unk> says that for the member is also a dream turned into reality playing in the country .
this was stated by the <unk> and founding member , <unk> <unk> , who spoke exclusively with <unk> , from brazil , last week .
the group is on the south american zone within the tour celebrating two decades of work and sunday 00th will make its only stop in central america .
that day they will be present at the national stadium , starting at <unk> <unk> , together with the <unk> of los angeles the x and the <unk> of the nationals las <unk> .
this is an <unk> of the conversation , whose full <unk> is online in the nation .
for your followers from costa rica , is a dream come true that <unk> <unk> will play in costa rica ? are you aware of what your <unk> are experiencing ?
going to costa rica is a dream come true for us too .
this is only our second time in south and central america and so far has been great .
i <unk> been to costa rica only once , on <unk> , it is a beautiful country and i think we 'll be able to stay a few days there .
so we are <unk> to bring our music there .
i ask this because there is a kind of devotion to the <unk> ; the <unk> live with intensity the days before the concert .
what do you say to your most <unk> followers ?
thank you for staying with us through all these years .
it took us almost 00 years to get to costa rica , thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get here .
some people as regards your concert refer to it as the biggest show of the year .
does this add a bit of pressure on your visit ?
some of the biggest shows we <unk> played over the past 00 years occurred during the last couple of weeks .
we had a few wonderful shows in <unk> paulo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in costa rica .
really , we are very eager to play there .
we love this country , we love to <unk> and the <unk> , for both things , costa rica is one of the best countries in the world .
how did you discover costa rica and its waves for <unk> ?
we have many friends who are surfers and i have a great friend who lives in <unk> and the waves here are incredible .
my friends are always going to <unk> in costa rica and nicaragua , along with mexico , these are great places to <unk> , and that 's how we learned about , through people who love <unk> .
viewing the tour , one can say that you have been making great shows with lots of <unk> .
what have you planned for the presentation in costa rica ?
as we have never played there before , then we have no restrictions on what we can do .
we will try to make the best show possible with a good variety of <unk> ; we will try to play a couple of <unk> of each <unk> and give our <unk> a good and diverse <unk> .
you never repeat the <unk> .
how come ?
i think it 's partly because we have nine <unk> and we can play more than 000 <unk> and everyone likes different <unk> , so it 's difficult to choose which <unk> to play every night .
when we have two or three <unk> in the <unk> that we have not been playing for a while , this keeps us focused and keeps us surprised because it reminds us the reasons why we liked those <unk> and that we might have forgotten .
that makes the show more interesting for us and therefore i think it also makes it more interesting for the people .
with this tour , you are celebrating 00 years of experience .
looking back , is it hard to believe all you have made ?
yes , absolutely .
first , i think none of us could ever imagine we <unk> be in a rock <unk> and doing this for over 00 years makes it seem like a dream .
we count our <unk> and we are very <unk> that we can continue making music together .
we all love each other and love making music .
we are fortunate to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go .
things could not be better for us .
what does it mean for you having been a fundamental part of the rise of <unk> ?
it has always been an <unk> to be a part of that group of great bands .
we are good friends of the people of <unk> , <unk> and alice in chains .
it 's amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it is unusual .
from time to time , arises a <unk> of a city , but it is much more strange when five or ten bands come out at the same time from the same city .
we are proud and <unk> to be part of the <unk> group .
i still play with some of them from time to time .
last year , we were at a festival with alice in chains and we were in canada with <unk> , we saw <unk> in its tour , so we are fortunate to be friends with all of them and we are <unk> to be part of the <unk> sound that aroused .
it is also very strange that a <unk> like yours remains united with the same members for so long .
yes , four of us were together for 00 years and <unk> ( <unk> ) joined us 00 years ago , which , by itself , is much longer than many bands lasted .
first , i think we are all lucky to be still alive and , secondly , we all care about the others .
we are all very close friends and , thanks to this , there have also been opened <unk> avenues that give each the freedom to experiment .
we trust each other with the music of each and this could not be better .
your relationship to the word <unk> has not been easy ; but thanks to your success , you have been able to do whatever you wanted .
how do you find a balance ?
as we have grown , it has been easier to find a balance .
we take care of not being too much on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who love your music .
while one remembers that people are there for the music , that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it , without setting your mind on being famous and being a rock star , something that none of us really <unk> about .
how do you remember your other project <unk> love bone ?
i think we write very good <unk> and at the beginning was a great thing .
we were a <unk> for almost three years and never released an <unk> until after the death of <unk> ( andrew <unk> ) .
there were many <unk> because lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still close friends of <unk> ( fair - weather ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) , who started in the <unk> with us and when i hear a song or see a picture i think of the incredible person that <unk> was and how he made <unk> laugh , it was always a pleasure to go to work , laugh , talk about music and football and much more .
it was a remarkable man and we miss him .
the national <unk> las <unk> will be responsible for opening the show in costa rica .
is it true that you know its work , especially <unk> <unk> , and that 's why you chose it for the opening ?
yes , the production sent us several videos proposals and that was the <unk> that we liked most , so we <unk> anxious to see what las <unk> can offer live and should be very <unk> .
why do you always change the <unk> of yellow <unk> live ?
that is a question for ed ( <unk> <unk> ) , so i do not know .
he <unk> it and i think he does this with the first thing that comes to his mind .
as a <unk> , what are your influences ?
there are so many .
within the first that come to my mind are <unk> <unk> , john <unk> , <unk> <unk> , john <unk> , paul <unk> , chuck <unk> ...
there are so many i could talk all afternoon about the <unk> that i love .
how did <unk> <unk> succeeded to maintain <unk> relevant despite of not being any longer a <unk> ?
i think all of us feel a bit disconnected from the word <unk> .
when i think of it , it reminds me of the bands i mentioned before , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and all that came at the same time , and if it is important now , i think it 's wonderful because it is music worth listening to and bands as <unk> are making now music better than ever .
at first , your music had a <unk> content , and now has become more positive .
how do you explain this change ?
it 's interesting because i think there are a couple of <unk> on the <unk> that may appear <unk> , but there are <unk> like the end or just breathe that are qualified as very dark although they can sound a little positive .
with both , when ed played them , i cried when i heard them , and these <unk> are profoundly dark .
i think that when you grow up and there was some <unk> in your life and you lost a family member or friend , these things start to influence your art and your music and these two <unk> certainly represent that for me .
also , i think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark .

the balance of the first 00 years of life of the social support entity <unk> is important : 0,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this century quarter .

an occupied farm where macro parties were given was <unk>
the <unk> had seized 00 of the 00 floors of the building , <unk> , 00
the 00 <unk> left the farm at noon yesterday without a fight
it seems that the nightmare lived by the <unk> residing in 00 <unk> street has come to an end .
twelve people left voluntarily yesterday at noon the property they were illegally occupying , and where they <unk> macro parties that <unk> the <unk> , by court order without police intervention .
when the operation was finished the lock on the door was changed in order to prevent a repeat of the situation .
" from now on there will be an access control , " said the manager .
the <unk> , who had invaded 00 of the 00 floors of the building , the rest are inhabited - took all the <unk> and part of the water , painted the walls and left residues of all kinds , especially alcoholic beverage <unk> .
the first three floors were the scene of mass parties , which lasted up to two days and <unk> the <unk> .
next to the building there is a <unk> , <unk> 00 , which has also been damaged .
the <unk> , maria <unk> told to europa press that since the building was occupied her business went down 00 % .
the <unk> of the club says that the <unk> of the farm made <unk> an unfair competition , since they were selling drinks for three euros , while in the club worth 00 .
in addition , the <unk> of the <unk> had to respond to <unk> complaints of noise , while , as she noted , the noise was not caused by customers of the club , but by the inhabitants of the <unk> and , above all , those attending the parties that were <unk> there , which had increased in frequency and intensity in recent weeks , as the angry <unk> said .
the head of the club said that the <unk> was so great that even reached an agreement with the <unk> of the property and there are now nine months since she " <unk> " him for paying the rent .
the city police also confirmed that in recent weeks has received more complaints from <unk> about the situation .

in this sense , he added that " it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be strongly against the <unk> that has been generated on the farm . "
also yesterday , the members of the police <unk> a building in <unk> <unk> .
at <unk> the police went to 00 <unk> street after receiving a call from a <unk> who had noticed that four people had entered the building .
the four were arrested at the time .
park or mountain ?
the architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond <unk> over fees
the municipal <unk> on the 00 doors reopened the debate on the role of <unk> in barcelona
in mid 00 's at the height of the now extinct <unk> corporation of barcelona ( <unk> ) , this administration printed promotional leaflets of <unk> .
the <unk> defined the mountain as the great park of the <unk> barcelona .
moreover , it was accompanied by a comparison , in figures , with the new york central park .
on the death of the <unk> , in 0000 , the park was placed again in the minds of many , as the upper limit of barcelona , <unk> the catalan capital one of the few that is not oriented towards the north - south but up ( mountain ) - down ( sea ) .
the classification of <unk> as a natural park <unk> in this idea .
the reference was not central park , but <unk> , with the wild <unk> on the role of <unk> bear .
this was all about until , in september , the council called for a mega competition composed of 00 <unk> for as many other doors to <unk> .
a door refers to the idea of the park , no doubt .
either that or someone wants to put gates to the field .
the question comes alone : <unk> ? park or mountain ?
the competition , both as for its merely <unk> side as for its reflection on the city is a topic of conversation among all architects of barcelona .
it 's almost a recurrent theme to make use of when two members of this ancient <unk> of elected persons <unk> themselves in an <unk> .
and this fact gives rise precisely to one of the few <unk> between what three architects of barcelona are saying and the academics , which have been presented .
<unk> <unk> , daniel <unk> and <unk> <unk> : the competition is appropriate
for <unk> , after approaching the coastline becomes " necessary " to discuss about " the mountain front , " whenever <unk> <unk> 's speech , that of green apples has not been carried out .
" it should be assumed that the largest park in barcelona is the <unk> .
among other things , for its great accessibility .
<unk> is more complex , " says the architect to whom the title of " gates of <unk> " contains a " <unk> trap " : we should not think about them " as access to a park , but as the delimitation of some areas where we must act . "
<unk> , as <unk> and <unk> with experience in the urban world , called the proposal " intellectual challenge " with " some dangers . "
hazards arising from the " uncertainty of projecting the public space " after the experience of the 00 " s which had in the forum area " his <unk> song . "
the first fear is the own delimitation of the borders where to build .
" limiting something is setting up the next step , " meaning , overcoming .
" we must think of new urban planning tools , because the current [ in reference to the general <unk> plan ( <unk> ) ] can lead to a real disaster . "
<unk> to the question , <unk> believes that simplifying the <unk> <unk> side " can be understood as a park , barcelona , <unk> " by a purely <unk> issue .
<unk> remembers that there is already a work done by the board of <unk> that " should not fall on deaf ears , " although he is grateful for the opportunity that the city hall offers to his profession to intervene in this project " from the very beginning . "
and further , understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate , but " he doubts " about whether this technical profile is the one that should lead multidisciplinary teams ( " a success , " he points ) that have had to create : " the architects should be only a tool . "
<unk> suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex , because the <unk> rules lack a global view of <unk> : " 00 cross <unk> have been called - he says - on sea - mountain sense , but there is no <unk> reading , to see and understand the area as a whole . "
this leads , at least in this case , to have chosen to participate in the 00 <unk> .
otherwise , a project for one of the gates can <unk> into the program and definition with the project of the architect of the next gate .
in your opinion , the council should ensure that the <unk> immediately above the <unk> de <unk> should provide in its entirety , an area of equipment to conduct a smooth transition between the city and the green .
casino <unk> <unk> <unk> and this one will be free
after 00 days of arrangements , the legal representative of the red casino <unk> the brother of the mayor of <unk> of the process against him for alleged extortion

on october 00th he was transferred to <unk> allegedly for <unk> with a half million of <unk> the owners of red casino , but he stayed there only a few hours in the medium - security prison because there were death threats against him .
the authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells boarding san nicolas of <unk> .
on october 00th he an arrest order was issued by the <unk> of second criminal <unk> court , <unk> <unk> , who said that after nearly two months of inquiries there was enough evidence to establish the guilt of <unk> , such as the collection of 0.0 million <unk> from the representatives of the <unk> in exchange for allowing the operation of it .
on monday , the legal representative of red casino , victor <unk> <unk> <unk> , appeared before the judge josé luis <unk> to seek pardon for the regional mayor 's brother , so that in the coming hours he might regain his freedom .
during the legal diligence , the public prosecutor attached to the court , <unk> <unk> , questioned <unk> <unk> whether he had repaired the damage and which of the partners of the <unk> house granted pardon , although the lawyer tried to reserve the name .
based on the record 000/0000 legal pardon is granted to <unk> <unk> and thereafter there may not be made <unk> claim about the process that was intended against him ; also no damage repair or punishment will be required .
after the hearing of the legal representative of the <unk> , at almost <unk> it was ordered the immediate release of <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of the court , <unk> <unk> , went to the jail of the municipality of san nicolas of <unk> to notify <unk> that he has been legally <unk> and his record will be filed .

the secretary <unk> <unk> <unk> gives details of the <unk> where the interior minister , <unk> <unk> , and seven others died .
the ministry of communications and transportation ( <unk> ) reported that the results obtained on the accident in which the interior secretary <unk> <unk> <unk> , and seven others died , indicate that the helicopter hit directly the ground in complete structural integrity , without the pilot attempting a forced landing .
during a press conference , <unk> <unk> <unk> , minister of communications and transport , said that before the aircraft took off , the pilot found that weather conditions were suitable for the flight .
" the elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground , the <unk> came into contact with trees at 00 <unk> where the unit lost the <unk> . "
he also reported that the unit was designed for 00 people , so it fulfilled the necessary requirements to transport people .
he also said that the investigations made <unk> the area of impact do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground .
" in a research it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship in another place , the impact is presented in a structural way .
" the design of the helicopter conceived for 00 passengers , fulfilled the appropriate requirements for transporting passengers .
the land has a <unk> of seven degrees to 00 degrees .
for now , the secretary said it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible ; however , the investigation may take several months or even one year .
meanwhile , <unk> <unk> meyer , general director of airports and auxiliary services , said that at the time of the impact , the presidential helicopter was operating in <unk> speed and that this happened in a soft <unk> land .
" this information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal <unk> operation at the time of the impact , " he said .
at the press conference , the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , listed six important elements in the investigation :
visual flight :
according to the aviation regulations the flight was conducted under visual flight rules , this means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground .
weather conditions :
<unk> reports were indicating suitable conditions for taking off as the aircraft moved towards the border area between mexico city and mexico state there were layers of <unk> at low <unk> .
selected routes :
it is likely that due to cloud conditions the crew has <unk> an area of lower <unk> and greater visibility into the <unk> of <unk> .
location of the impact .
the coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft radar match , probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change in the flight direction .
dispersion of <unk> on a small area :
the information available so far suggests that the impact occurred in a straight and lateral line .
the dispersion of the <unk> suggests that the helicopter struck the ground in conditions of structural integrity .
there was not detected evidence of fire or explosion :
on the area of the accident there remains <unk> evidence in the <unk> of the craft , some kind of explosion or fire .
recent research results indicate it may have had multiple contacts with the ground .
during the field work there have been found pieces of the aircraft at an altitude of 0.000 feet above mean sea level , the ground has a <unk> ranging from seven degrees to 00 degrees .
the pictures show the sequence in which it dismantled along that journey .
the information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground .
after a thorough research in a wider area than the <unk> off area , near the place the accident took place , there have not been found <unk> pieces of the aircraft , which strengthens the assumption that the impact is presented in terms of structural integrity .

he explained that on saturday to all participants will be applied <unk> <unk> ( weight , height , and <unk> <unk> ) , blood pressure <unk> , and determination of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and genetic ( seeking to identify <unk> that are associated to childhood obesity ) .
<unk> <unk> said that this research reflects the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in children .
health surveys made between 0000 and 0000 reported that in only six years there was an increase in the case of the boys , 00 percent were <unk> , and 00 percent in the case of the girls ; in terms of overweight there was also observed a dramatic rise , " said the specialist of the <unk> .
he said the justification for searching the <unk> is based on that the population of the country differs from other in its genetic history .
he reported that on average , the mexican has a 00 percent of american indian heritage , 00 percent european and five percent african and this condition is reflected in the <unk> that are associated with diabetes and overweight .
he explained that generally , the <unk> of obesity result in the inability to burn off the excess energy that we consume ( <unk> ) and which is stored as fat .
the researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is a comprehensive assessment of the children , which can detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity .
even , he said , the presence of dark - <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) on the neck and <unk> indicates the likelihood of suffering of <unk> disorders and even <unk> .
the information is handled with confidentiality , doctors deliver it in writing to the parents , to whom they explain each of the <unk> and changes in the lifestyle that have to be undertaken in order to prevent disease .
<unk> <unk> explained that there are three major components that cause overweight , obesity and other chronic diseases : sedentary lifestyle , which is the lack of daily physical activity , staying most of the day and watching tv and using means of transport instead of walking short distances .
also it is due to the high <unk> intake , meaning , and the increased consumption of <unk> drinks , <unk> ( <unk> , bread , <unk> , <unk> , etc. ) with high fat and protein and <unk> <unk> in this protocol .
<unk> asphalt would avoid <unk>
<unk> <unk> , a researcher at the <unk> of <unk> of <unk> , develops <unk> - modified asphalt to produce a mixture with the best performance , regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature
if the signals sent by the road surface were attended , it would be necessary to repair about 000 thousand <unk> every rainy season in the <unk> area of <unk> of mexico , said <unk> <unk> <unk> , a researcher at the <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) of the <unk> , who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate , the <unk> could be reduced or even completely eliminated .
in his <unk> a technological view of the <unk> , issued under the international year of <unk> , announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing a <unk> modified asphalt to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to the asphalt , but with a better mechanical strength , both at high and low temperatures .
<unk> <unk> said that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot , as some cities in the north , to improve its performance and , therefore , the formation of <unk> .
he explained that the asphalt , the heavier oil part is a set of <unk> <unk> , some of high <unk> weight , called <unk> , and other of low <unk> weight , called <unk> , which together give the road surface its <unk> characteristic <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures near 000 degrees , it <unk> like a liquid at <unk> c , its <unk> is very high and at 00 degrees <unk> has a nearly solid state , whereas at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes fragile , he said .
this means that the resistance of the street asphalt is not uniform , but is modified during the day according to the environmental conditions and temperature , said the specialist in chemical engineering .
<unk> researcher observed that the streets of mexico city are mostly covered by flexible pavement , which is composed of six layers of material , out of which the last three involve the asphalt .
among the most superficial layers is the asphalt , composed of small <unk> <unk> into the asphalt and then <unk> .
each of the <unk> which <unk> this covering , he said , is <unk> with asphalt .
when driving vehicles and generating effort , it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement .
if it were modified asphalt it would spread even better , said the chemical engineer .
on the asphalt covering , he added , is placed a final layer called rolling covering , which is made <unk> a fine stone material , meaning sand also <unk> into the asphalt .
since this is the layer that will be in contact with the <unk> of the vehicle , it must have a better mechanical strength than the asphalt covering and provide road friction .
as being the part of the pavement that will receive and diffuse the efforts , the rolling covering also requires proper thickness and the material it is made of must be take into consideration .
the weather , especially <unk> and temperature variations are also a very important factor to consider , especially water , he said , because it greatly affects the performance of the asphalt .
when the ground is wet , water <unk> inside the covering and it 's hard to get out , this causing a <unk> of all layers of the pavement and , therefore , the formation of <unk> .
in the formation of a <unk> , he said , the first to wear is the rolling covering and only after that is affected the asphalt , but the damage does not happen instantly , it is a process that should be attended at the first signs with appropriate maintenance <unk> .
also a member of the national system of researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of <unk> and , therefore , the thickness of each layer of the pavement should be always made in relation to the vehicle load and ensure this <unk> , in order to prevent the frequent formation of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> said that there is still much to investigate and work to do on the asphalt , for example , asphalt <unk> , which in other countries are already on the market and even help repair <unk> with <unk> and without using high temperatures .
what did the candidate of <unk> lack to be the new miss colombia ?
analysis of the factors that affected <unk> <unk> <unk> for not getting the crown of miss colombia .
the <unk> gets its title number 00 of <unk> .
once again <unk> <unk> remains with the desire of the crown of miss colombia .
this time <unk> <unk> <unk> had to be content with being on the winning <unk> , <unk> the silver crown and the <unk> that <unk> her as the new <unk> of colombia .
with the result obtained last night in <unk> , where miss atlantic won the crown and <unk> , the department counts with 00 <unk> titles and <unk> joins the <unk> of women of <unk> of <unk> who have been close to the crown but were proclaimed <unk> , among them <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 0000 ) , <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 0000 ) , <unk> <unk> ayala ( 0000 ) , <unk> <unk> ( 0000 ) , rose <unk> <unk> ( 0000 ) , <unk> maria arenas ( 0000 ) , <unk> <unk> ( 0000 ) , <unk> <unk> ( 0000 ) , maria <unk> <unk> ( 0000 ) , diana <unk> <unk> ( 0000 ) , <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 0000 ) , <unk> <unk> ( 0000 ) , <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 0000 ) .
now the big question many are asking is :
what was missing ? because the result is the defeat of a big <unk> who in each performance showed that she had everything to be the new miss colombia , not in vain she was elected queen of the police and best <unk> face of <unk> , titles that were obtained by <unk> as <unk> <unk> or natalia navarro , who took the crown of miss colombia .
the first key factor in the decision of the jury to designate her as first <unk> is that she did not convince with her answer to the question " ' what is the book that has marked you and why ? asked <unk> martin <unk> <unk> from the literary cart let 's read .
to the questioner she answered
" i read a lot , i believe a lot in literature , i think it is a form of <unk> , and i definitely think that the book that marked my childhood is " the little <unk> ' is a pretty deep book .
today i read " crime and punishment ' it is a book of universal literature that we all should read ; and now i <unk> reading the book by <unk> <unk> , a russian , a beautiful book called " the heat of blood . '
a response that the jury did not like due to the term " <unk> ' and second of all for not specifically explaining how each of the cited books have marked her .
but after the ceremony <unk> said she was calm and happy with the result " the <unk> is wise it happens what it has to happen . "
and for you all , please read a little bit , ' the little <unk> ' it is a great book "
among the launched <unk> it is said that <unk> got burned by <unk> .
a <unk> from <unk> suggested that for being the preferred , the <unk> , and the candidate who received all preliminary <unk> ( <unk> food challenge , the public vote for the best traditional <unk> , and mother queen ) , " that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates , stressed the queen and therefore she did not <unk> on stage .
and that was noted in her first appearance in <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> and during her two shows at the evening <unk> .
although in both she looked confident , it was noted that she lacked the strength and energy that <unk> and <unk> representatives did show .
<unk> <unk> , a journalist of the program " like home ' , of the <unk> channel said that the fact that <unk> was designated as <unk> " means that the candidate who more <unk> wins during the competition is not the queen . "
in addition , <unk> <unk> avoided talking to the press , and that was wrong .
another hypothesis is that <unk> failed to convince the jury about her interest in social work , which is ultimately the essence of the national <unk> <unk> .
this is why , two days before the election the international jury <unk> <unk> said they were seeking a woman committed to the social needs of her country .
" <unk> is not enough for a miss colombia , we must look beyond the physical appearance and focus on social awareness , before entering the <unk> they must be already involved in projects , " she said .
there is also a speculation that <unk> <unk> for her defects on the <unk> and the <unk> that could be seen on her <unk> , but it is contradictory because the jury specifically chose her as the candidate ' natural <unk> ' with the healthier body , good nutrition and responsible physical work .
the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> orozco <unk> that <unk> did not have the best body , that there were better , " but the problem of <unk> on the <unk> , which for me was not very noticeable , made her lose points the last day . "
meanwhile , the journalist guido <unk> , of <unk> magazine considers that the error of the <unk> of <unk> were the <unk> interventions she suffered .
" the <unk> are fine , but <unk> did not know how to do them .
her body was never her strong advantage and here is where she was punished .
for this award , which for the first time is given by the national <unk> <unk> , after the <unk> parade a cruel <unk> was fulfilled last night , it was said that this was the <unk> that <unk> granted to <unk> for not giving her the pleasure of taking the crown .
reality or not , the fact is that <unk> today begins a year of reign , not as sovereign , but as a <unk> , a position that gives her the opportunity to represent colombia in one of the international competitions designated by the national competition itself .
however , she will go down in history as one of the <unk> that despite her overwhelming passage through <unk> , found difficulties in getting the crown .
such was the work of the person who identified the body of <unk> <unk>
a <unk> <unk> entered into history as the man who confirmed the death of " <unk> <unk> .
the work of these officials is a key work .
on november 0th the <unk> of <unk> <unk> passed into history as the man who confirmed the identity of the <unk> top leader , " <unk> <unk> , through the comparison of his <unk> .
of the seven <unk> working in the branch of <unk> , this week it was the turn of " availability ' for <unk> <unk> , a man of <unk> <unk> , who had spent 00 years working in the area of judicial investigation .
at the beginning of his career , <unk> worked in municipalities of <unk> , where he often had to go for more than five days in the <unk> to reach the place where there were the bodies that should be identified .
in 0000 he moved to the capital of the <unk> and , after making the corresponding courses , he <unk> in <unk> , which is the study of skin friction , meaning the <unk> of the hands and feet .
the week of <unk> 's operation against <unk> <unk> <unk> he was warned to take clothes only for three days .
something big was coming .
on friday night he went from <unk> with a helicopter , to <unk> .
he knew he had to identify two <unk> and one was suspected to be of the man who led the world 's oldest guerrilla , so they asked him to take the ten print card of <unk> <unk> <unk> ( his real name ) .
however , when he arrived with the research team to the site where the body was , he did not <unk> him by his physical appearance ; it was very different from that seen in the media .
he was without <unk> , <unk> as a farmer of the area , without glasses and much <unk> .
but the <unk> do not lie .
accompanied by a <unk> <unk> glass , ink , a <unk> and a <unk> , <unk> compared the <unk> of the <unk> with those of the card .
his eye did not fail him : it was " <unk> <unk> ' .
that same night , the man from <unk> <unk> was asked to confirm the <unk> minister , <unk> carlos <unk> , that it was the top leader of the <unk> .
in search of the <unk>
for a <unk> specialist from <unk> of <unk> the recognition made <unk> the president <unk> manuel santos to <unk> <unk> in the press conference for the operation against " <unk> ' , is very significant .
many people do not know our work .
the <unk> science is an exact science , without error , which can be key solution in solving crimes .
apart from the identification of bodies , the <unk> specialists support research for crimes like theft and murder and confirm the identity of those captured .
when captured , many criminals have fake cards or do not have papers .
we will take their <unk> and seek them in the database .
the researcher said that , in a case of theft , he had to remove a piece of the wall of a house because in that place the <unk> had supported his hand on to take a safe full of <unk> and money .
" the walls are difficult because they are not suitable <unk> to get a print , but in this case we could get the print of the whole hand and identify the offender , who had participated in several <unk> " he said .
the <unk> can also rule out or confirm suspects in murder cases .
they have recently found a dead man , with <unk> bottles around him .
through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and , indeed , a print on the bottle matched .
although this does not guarantee that it was the murderer , it places him it in the murder scene .
a <unk> expert of <unk> explained that in objects " <unk> are drawn with chemical or physical <unk> . "
when they appear there is used a <unk> or tape to lift them .
after that , the <unk> are sent to <unk> , which is the criminal database , or at the registry .
" the problem is that there are still many <unk> <unk> , " said <unk> expert .
he clarified that not everything is as shown in <unk> television program .
just as not everything that <unk> is gold , not everything you touch turns into a footprint .
however , if it can be used , the comparison is being made .
the " angry persons " challenge the authorities in new york
hundreds of protesters were <unk> round in front of <unk> square to camp .
a part of the protesters listened to the <unk> order and moved to a nearby park .
the members of the movement occupy wall street challenged on tuesday the authorities of new york when trying to enter again , under the protection of a court order , in the manhattan square where they were <unk> at <unk> when trying to occupy another park of the big apple .
hundreds of protesters crowded round the <unk> square , where they wanted to get in thanks to a court order that allows " the angry persons " to camp on the site , while another part of the movement responded to the <unk> by occupying a park north the city where there have been made further arrests .
" our idea is that if the court does not allow us to return to camp in the square , we will camp somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to <unk> , and through peaceful sit - ins and demonstrations , " said one of the spokesmen of the movement " occupy wall street , " mark <unk> .
<unk> explained that the response of the " angry persons " to the <unk> of the camp issued personally by the mayor of new york , michael <unk> , came to court , where judge <unk> <unk> issued an order prohibiting the forced <unk> of the place and allowing the demonstrators to remain <unk> .
in addition , the " angry persons " proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> street and sixth avenue , near the entrance to the holland tunnel , which <unk> new york and new <unk> , owned by the parish of trinity church .
at least for one hour they were able to occupy the place , but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters , although <unk> could not confirm the precise number , while telling <unk> that he saw several journalists who were also <unk> .
the organization ensures that there are several hundred people <unk> at that point , where a delegation of religious leaders has already gone to show their support to the members of the movement trying to <unk> with the police .
meanwhile , <unk> square , which is a privately owned site , remains closed waiting for a court hearing scheduled for this tuesday in which to examine the legality of the <unk> of this morning .
some of the protesters moved there were carrying and distributing at that time <unk> of that court order and even they gave these <unk> to officers guarding the place , which led to " some small <unk> , " said <unk> , who claimed that some officers beaten the demonstrators .
the court order prohibits the authorities to evacuate the members of occupy wall street and enforce " laws that were issued after the beginning of the occupation or to prohibit demonstrators regain access to the park with shops and other property used before . "
mayor <unk> told reporters that , because of that court order , the city had suspended the reopening of the public space and protesters were informed , however , that local laws do not allow them to re - install with <unk> shops and <unk> bags .
the <unk> personally defended the <unk> of the <unk> square carried out at <unk> , an operation in which about 000 arrests were made and this was decided so because protesters were " violating the law . "
<unk> said he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming " a place where people did not come to protest , but to break the law and , in some cases , to do harm to others " as " some businesses had received threats ' and <unk> feared " for the quality of life . "
" the <unk> of this morning was <unk> and shows that deep inside <unk> is more interested in preserving the financial interests of american workers , " added the spokesman of the movement , who accused the mayor of " <unk> for the freedom of expression . "
the responsible of " occupy wall street " also indicated that they intend to organize " great deeds " for thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions , in order to commemorate the last two months of protests , which began on september 00th .
<unk> <unk> will be <unk> <unk> in a special christmas tv show
along with michael <unk> and other prominent <unk> , she will appear on the television program " it 's a <unk> <unk> christmas " on december <unk>
the canadian <unk> <unk> has been the assistant of <unk> <unk> in " home improvement " <unk> in " <unk> " <unk> in " <unk> , " the wife of rock <unk> <unk> lee and now , the <unk> and model is the <unk> <unk> in a special christmas show at the canadian television .
the private television channel <unk> announced today that <unk> , along with the " <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> ) michael <unk> and other prominent <unk> , will appear on the television program " it 's a <unk> <unk> christmas " on december <unk> , interpreting a very different <unk> .
<unk> presented today images of the television show in which <unk> , also known by the wide distribution over the internet of a pornographic home video where she appears together with her <unk> , the <unk> of " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> lee , appears <unk> as the <unk> <unk> holding in a <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in the scene , <unk> , a well known canadian <unk> of indian origin who recently appeared as a <unk> on the tour of " my violent <unk> of truth " by charlie <unk> appears as joseph .
in addition to <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> christmas special show features the canadian <unk> <unk> , who at the end of march <unk> in <unk> <unk> the <unk> model <unk> <unk> , and he is not a <unk> as regards the controversy .
recently , <unk> called " <unk> " the american <unk> <unk> during one of his <unk> in new york .
japan <unk> after the earthquake
gdp grows by 0.0 % due to domestic consumption and puts an end to the downward spiral that began in march
since last march , the japanese economy was <unk> , still recovering from the devastating earthquake , resulting in a nuclear crisis , the worst catastrophe suffered by the <unk> country since the second world war .
the first estimates of <unk> government regarding the material losses amounted to <unk> 000,000 million , a blow that , despite the difficult global context , seems to have <unk> .
after three consecutive quarters of <unk> , the gross domestic product data between july and september helped to turn the page , definitely : gdp increased by 0.0 % compared to the previous quarter and by 0 % in <unk> rate .
the one recorded in the second quarter , for the japanese the fiscal year begins in march 0000 - represents also the fastest rhythm of growth from january to march 0000 .
the recovery can be explained in part by the recovery in the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the following tsunami .
in fact , companies increased their investment by 0.0 % versus 0.0 % decline in capital expenditures which was observed from january to march , the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases .
however , the true <unk> of the japanese economy is not based exclusively on the <unk> <unk> that invites taking advantage on the crisis to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure , using of gaps to grow from scratch .
japan has <unk> , especially thanks to the evolution of the household consumption , which now represents 00 % of the japanese gdp .
this variable <unk> 0 % , driven by the increase of expenditure for cars , <unk> and leisure activities .
the stigma of the yen
<unk> has entrusted to the internal market , when the yen - the <unk> currency has become one of the " refuge values " chosen by investors who wanted to get rid of the debt crisis in the euro area and the negative forecasts of the <unk> , a privilege that weighs like a stone in the accounts of export companies .
with a stronger currency , the products are more expensive abroad , a serious slap for a country whose economic line is determined by the health of large technological groups .
<unk> or <unk> , for example , blamed the yen for their weak results between july and september .
as markets continue their siege of the peripheral countries of the eu , the government of <unk> <unk> does not lower the guard .
" we must be vigilant to the risks that remain , such as the deterioration of some foreign economies , the impact of floods in thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen , " said yesterday the secretary of state for economic policy , <unk> <unk> .
and indeed , the perspectives are not encouraging .
the organization for cooperation and economic development ( oecd ) said that most member countries showed in september clear signs of economic slowdown .
the indicator that anticipates the turning points in the global economy showed that the major powers are slowing .
since it fell four <unk> to 000.0 points , compared to 000.0 in august .
the euro zone even fell below the average , which is at the level of 000 , since it rushed eight <unk> up to 00.00 points .
athens feeds back the doubts
<unk> said that adjustments will be approved , but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
with peripheral risk subsidies launched and uncertainty reinstated in the parks , greece is still <unk> in the maze that leads to the exit of the great european debt crisis .
the feeling that the " consent " of the new transitional government of <unk> comes imposed more by the demands of brussels than by a genuine conviction of political forces began to be confirmed by facts .
while the new prime minister , <unk> <unk> warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed in his appointment may be underestimated for applying them , the leader of the conservative new democracy party , <unk> <unk> , ensured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled on february 00th .
" the main task of this government is implementing the decisions of the summit of october 00th , " <unk> said yesterday when opening a parliamentary debate that it will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new executive .
a package of 00 <unk> to boost employment , reform of the <unk> code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives .
however , the message of <unk> does not clear the doubts about his position : " we are committed to helping the transitional government , but we are not committed to anything . "
the conservative leader was one step further in his pulse to the eu and the <unk> , the entities that must <unk> the 0,000 million that athens urgently needed , and made <unk> he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments .
but the european commission , still having a <unk> rash by the impact caused by the all or nothing statement of the papandreou referendum , reiterated yesterday that its demand is clear : it will not unlock the help if the new government and the leaders of <unk> major parties do not sign " a written commitment without ambiguity and this as soon as possible . "
the economic affairs spokesman , <unk> <unk> , said the troika <unk> would return " very soon " to athens to discuss with the new government " what has to be done to pay the sixth tranche " of 0,000 million , although there is no definite date .
the greek <unk> still has a thread for the moment .
mrs. sofia : " they are instruments of progress and hope "
the queen highlights the " dominant " place in spain in relation to this type of finance
spain " has achieved a prominent place worldwide in the role of <unk> . "
queen sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become over the last two decades the second donor in relation to the instruments of cooperation ; whose " essence " she said lies in being an " instrument for social progress , justice and hope for a better future for all humanity , based on trust in human beings . "
the queen opened yesterday the fifth global microcredit summit in <unk> with the belief that " there is no doubt " that such operations are " absolutely essential " to achieve the millennium goals set by the united nations for 0000 , and , " especially having as a goal halving the volume of people living with less than a dollar per day , with this fixing the " poverty line . "
spain is " still working " to expand the network of beneficiaries all over the world , and assumes the task with " responsibility " said mrs. sofia , who hoped that the efforts and contributions originated in the summit , which will be held until thursday , will " ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest people , and especially for women , " the main beneficiaries of these loans .
there are " many achievements " and " many challenges we are facing . "
the microcredit summit arises not only as a forum for debate , but also as a platform that promotes " two basic goals . "
thus , his majesty explained that she hopes that at the end of 0000 , 000 million poor families will have acceded to these financial services and one hundred million of these households will get out of the poverty in which they are immersed .
the <unk> for the creation of <unk> credits in spain and in the rest of the world " has followed the path started years ago " by <unk> <unk> , highlighted mrs. sofia as an " act of justice and recognition . "
and she described the father of this tool as an " admirable <unk> of the universal cause of the fight against poverty , " whose work is known for 00 years , when the queen went to bangladesh to find out in the field the policy of loans .
this experience was followed a year later by the first world summit in washington and other meetings such as those held in ivory coast in 0000 , canada 0000 , and " in all i have seen the continued evolution , " said his majesty , whose link with this project made her earn yesterday the title of the " head of the family " in <unk> from the " <unk> of the poor . "
finally , the queen mrs. sofia concluded by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and find solutions to advance the fight against poverty .
" ethical imperative "
foreign minister , <unk> <unk> , said that solidarity " is an ethical imperative " to every democratic state .
in this regard , she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic boom , as it is a " continuing obligation . "
<unk> found that microcredit <unk> " a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty , " and now " more than ever , " the governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not let this fall as victim of adjustments .
for spain , microcredit is " one of the main lines of development cooperation . "
the secretary of state for international cooperation , <unk> <unk> , praised the " success " to give " trust " to people " excluded to whom all doors are closed , " and the mayor of <unk> , <unk> javier <unk> de la <unk> , welcomed those present to a city that " opens its doors caught by the spirit of solidarity . "
cdu intends to elect the european president by universal suffrage
the first day of the congress of the christian democratic union ( cdu ) on monday 00 november , in <unk> took place without any real problems arising for the chancellor angela merkel , who is also president of the christian democratic party .
the future of europe was not initially planned to be on the programme , but imposed itself in the autumn , in particular to satisfy the militants who will be watching the government 's policy on greece today and perhaps that on italy tomorrow <unk>
the motion on the <unk> of the european commission , tabled by the directorate , was adopted almost unanimously .
out of 0000 delegates , only nine voted against and ten abstained from voting .
the standing ovation lasting several minutes which they , angela merkel and then a few hours later , wolfgang schäuble , the very europhile minister of finance , received at the end of their respective speeches , left no room for doubt .
the main idea of the chancellor and of the motion , is embodied in the slogan " the right response to the crisis is not less europe , but more europe . "
not only because europe means peace , but because " nine million jobs depend directly on the euro . "
for the chancellor , " the time has arrived for a breakthrough in europe . "
this could mean modifications of the treaty of lisbon , making it possible to strengthen the control by the european union of the budgetary policies of the countries of the eurozone , but this could also affect the election of the president of the european commission by universal suffrage " in order to <unk> a face to europe . "
this is , generally speaking , the case of one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress , whose inspiration clearly comes from wolfgang schäuble .
certainly , it is not probable that the twenty - seven will rapidly agree to this solution ; great britain is opposed to it and the heads of cdu think that nicolas sarkozy is also opposed to it .
but the marker is in place .
similarly , the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the vote of each country - member of the directorate of the european central bank according the size of its economy , which would clearly increase the weight of the german economy .
anxious to calm the climate in her party , the chancellor increased the number of her references to konrad <unk> and to <unk> kohl , but she did not seek to influence the congress on the back of the " small " european countries , or of countries in difficulty , which are quick to criticise " arrogant " germany .
although the motion on europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of " franco - german friendship , " angela merkel did not mention france .
except when in a hole .
recalling that two centuries ago , <unk> was the scene of a bloody battle .
in fact , it was one of the most humiliating <unk> of the <unk> army .
what is sick leave fraud ?
after allowances , the <unk> and the government are launching an offensive against sick leave .
on 00 november , nicolas sarkozy will be in <unk> to visit a family allowances allocation fund and to make a speech on this subject , which has been recurring since 0000 , concerning the fight against social assistance fraud .
and to help this offensive stemming from a desire to make economies in the context of constraints , but which also forms part of the presidential re - election campaign , the majority want to concentrate on sick leave .
first and foremost , with a view to budgetary economies , the government intends to impose on private employees a fourth day of unemployment before the start of unemployment benefit
clearly , without the specific consent of the employer , an employee falling sick will lose four days ' pay equal to at least 00 % of his / her monthly income .
a measure , which threatens to arouse anger , but which , according to <unk> <unk> , would produce a saving of 000 million euros .
and which would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic effect , namely , the imposition on public employees of one day 's wait for benefit payment in the case of sick leave ( public employees have not hitherto had to wait for the payment of benefit , as against a three days ' wait by private employees ) .
now that these questions are being discussed , the majority are also relaunching the subject of fraud , targeting abuses linked to medical certificates .
" the controls will become more rigid and in addition , if you are caught , you will have to <unk> any non - legitimate benefit received , " warned <unk> <unk> on <unk> on sunday 00 november .
as in other cases , the effects of the announcement appear a little disproportionate to the reality of medical certificate - related fraud .
this has actually been monitored constantly since 0000 via political <unk> , which have usually borne fruit .
the french are no <unk> than people elsewhere in europe .
let us first of all look at the national figures .
according to the <unk> <unk> d'assurance <unk> ( <unk> ) , over 000 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 0000 .
according to <unk> de <unk> et de documentation en <unk> de la <unk> , the daily compensation expenditure in 0000 at 00,0 thousand million euros , was 0 % of total health expenditure .
of this sum , 00 % concerned maternity leave and accidents at work and 00 % sick leave benefit at <unk> thousand million euros .
and therefore represented <unk> % of health - related expenditure .
the french spent an average of 00,0 days on sick leave in 0000 , compared with 00.0 days in 0000 , according to a study by <unk> consulting group .
an average , which conceals certain divergences ; another inquiry published in 0000 by the <unk> career management site , showed that 00 % of the 00 000 french employees questioned said that they had not taken any days of sick leave .
another study , this time concerning sickness <unk> , states that in 0000 , 00 % of sick leave lasted less than 0 days , 00 % 00 days to one month , 00 % from one to three months and 00 % lasted longer .
comparing these figures with those of their european neighbours , french employees are no more inclined to take sick leave than those in any other country .
a long study carried out in 0000 by two <unk> researchers showed that between 0000 and 0000 , the global rate of absence from work in france ( for reasons of health or not ) <unk> between 00 % and 00 % , compared with between 00 % and 00 % in denmark , 00 % in the united kingdom , or between 00 % and 00 % in the netherlands .
sickness certificate - related fraud is very low , compared with " black " labour .
as regards fraud , it is very low .
the strengthening of legislation since 0000 has led to systematic controls of certificates valid for longer than 00 days .
in 0000 , out of <unk> million controls , the <unk> found that 00 % of the 000 000 controls on short - term sickness certificates were " unjustified , " or too long , " equal to 00 000 cases .
in the case of systematically controlled certificates valid for more than 00 days , 00 % cases were found to be " inappropriate or unjustified " out of <unk> million , equal to 000 000 .
in total therefore , 000 000 cases were " unjustified , " out of several million of employees issued with certificates .
a figure which represents very few cases , compared , for example , with the " black " labour figure .
according to the <unk> deputy <unk> <unk> , author of a report on the subject in june , this would represent 0 to 00 thousand million euros annual tax shortfall , equal to more than the total cost of daily compensation and therefore infinitely higher than losses due to fraud .
<unk> : greece must implement a new adjustment plan
greece needs a new programme of adjustment to rescue its economy .
this was declared on monday 00 november by the prime minister lucas <unk> in parliament , adding that the 000 days granted to his coalition government were not long enough for the accomplishment of this task .
" to pursue the efforts of rescuing the economy , we need the support of our european partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment " declared the head of government , who made his first public speech opening the debate on the vote of confidence in parliament on wednesday .
the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the eurozone on 00 october shall be the " principal task " of the new government , because participation of the country in the eurozone " is at stake , " he added .
consequently , <unk> <unk> forecast that the country 's public deficit would be reduced to " about 0 % " of the <unk> by the end of the year , after having been 00.0 % in 0000 and 00.0 % in 0000 .
the right rejects new austerity measures
on monday , <unk> <unk> , the leader of the right , gave his support to already approved measures to try and emerge from the debt crisis , but warned that his party would not support additional austerity .
" we will not vote in favour of new measures , " he said at a meeting with the <unk> of his new democracy party .
he declared his agreement with the objectives of reduction of the deficit and of the debt and of the struggle against waste , but also his opposition to any policy which would prevent economic recovery .
to <unk> rehn , the european commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs , who warned that the <unk> and the eu would not <unk> the loan of 0 thousand million euros required , without a written guarantee of all parties that they would support the planned measures , antonio <unk> replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under outside pressure .
it is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide , says a committee of experts
<unk> are living half dead , according to a report of the royal society of canada
regarding palliative medicine , the committee claims that governments , healthcare institutions and doctors work together to provide the best possible palliative care , apart from cancer cases .
canadian society is half dead .
only 0 % of <unk> agree to speak with their doctor when they want to die and take steps to that end .
this is one the conclusions of an imposing report by the royal society of canada , in which six experts in different fields took part , including ethics , the law and medicine .
this committee recommends to the government to modify the criminal code , so as to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia when it is elected by a patient deemed competent to make such a decision .
at the outset , the experts cite a recent inquiry by the economist intelligence unit , which compared the quality of death in 00 countries worldwide .
whilst canada is placed 00th , the study notes that " the <unk> of death in canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to tackle the subject of death .
<unk> or not , 00 % of <unk> do not have access to palliative care , report experts appointed by the royal society of canada .
and 00 % of them end by dying in hospital
<unk> , it is in <unk> that the rate is highest , with 00 % of deaths taking place in hospital .
on the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide , the authors of the report arrive at conclusions which oppose the position of the federal government , which has already said that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide .
now , according to the experts who also reviewed the position of all countries where these actions have been legalised or <unk> , there is no proof that the aid <unk> involves abuses of application , that is to say , the practice of euthanasia , or of assisted suicide on persons who are not competent , or not consenting .
on the contrary , affirmed during a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who submitted the report , more such cases were found precisely in those countries , where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalised .
" euthanasia is practised in canada , where it is clearly illegal . "
" assisted suicide is practised in canada , where it is clearly illegal , explains <unk> <unk> .
<unk> in favour of euthanasia
it should be remembered that 00 % of <unk> are in favour of euthanasia , because according to an <unk> <unk> enquiry in 0000 , they believe that it would allow persons at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering .
and the legalisation of euthanasia would not result in sending a message that the life of aged or <unk> persons had less value .
regarding persons who commit assisted suicide , investigations indicate that 00 % of such cases should not have been prosecuted .
regarding the continuation , or the withdrawal of <unk> care of a patient , the situation is less clear , say the authors of the report .
they also suggest among their other recommendations , that the penal code should state that legally valid withdrawal of <unk> care is not criminal .
the committee of experts also requests that health professionals should be trained in the duty to respect a withdrawal of <unk> care at the end of life without having to fear criminal prosecution .
regarding palliative care , the committee calls on governments , <unk> institutions , and doctors to work together to provide the best possible palliative care and not only in cases of cancer .
lastly , concerning palliative <unk> already widely used in canadian health institutions , the committee asks that it should be considered where it only serves to reduce physical pain , as does euthanasia and that it should be subject to the same procedures .
reservations of other experts
certain experts in the field of the health - related legislation have already voiced reservations concerning the conclusions of the royal society of canada experts ' report .
<unk> pierre <unk> , a specialist in health legislation , described as " extreme " the position of the experts who signed the report , because among other things , it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to terminal cases .
" this opens the door on a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who is over 00 years old , could ask for help to commit suicide , says me <unk> , who yesterday consulted a summary of the report .
me <unk> also stresses that the authors of the report appear to place the independence of the person above all other values which contribute to the fabric of society
he says that " in society there are <unk> and constraints .
the specialist in health legislation , margaret <unk> also expressed " strong opposition to the conclusions of the report , which she described as being " obviously pro - euthanasia . "
margaret <unk> , who is herself a member of the royal society of canada , <unk> , in particular , the data of the report concerning abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have been legalised as in the netherlands and in <unk> .

italy
<unk> demands time from the markets and sacrifices from italians
the future head of the italian government , mario <unk> , has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and to implement a programme , which will involve " sacrifices , " in order to recover credibility lost over the last few months of the <unk> government .
the former european commissioner was yesterday in discussions with the political parties before today 's meeting with unions and employers
he will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet composed of <unk> from outside parliament .
" <unk> spoke about an important programme involving a lot of sacrifices , " said <unk> <unk> , a deputy of one of the numerous small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting the prime minister - designate .
the president of the chamber or <unk> , <unk> <unk> , said that he would wait to learn if mario <unk> would ask parliament for a vote of confidence between now and friday , to ascertain whether the new government had enough support .
the consultations will end in the presentation by <unk> <unk> of a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of state , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> here , asking them for time .
in a " democracy , time is needed for the preparation of a government and a programme , he stressed , adding that he was certain that the markets would be patient and understanding . "
his appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets , but disquiet re - emerged , in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in eurozone in september .
the prime minister - designate had to form a team , most importantly comprising <unk> , even though he stressed that he would also like to include " politicians . "
the new government would have to last until 0000 , the date of the next election , he said .
according to the president of the chamber of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the new government would secure the vote of confidence of parliament by friday .
<unk> <unk> undertook that once in office he would work hard to ensure that italy would once again become a protagonist in europe .
a spokesman for the european commissioner , <unk> rehn . stressed that " regardless of a new government , our diagnostic of the italian economy has not changed . "
the european union , being convinced that rome would not achieve its objective budget in 0000 despite the austerity plan adopted over recent months , has asked , in particular , for stringent new measures .
the italian " boss of bosses " <unk> <unk> , who will meet him on tuesday , has also insisted on the necessity of relaunching the economy , " because a country which does not have growth , cannot observe the parameters of deficit . "
<unk> <unk> , known for his competence and for his independence when he was european commissioner ( 0000-0000 ) , represents a " change of epoch " for italy after 00 years of " <unk> , " the " professor " symbolising " the challenge of seriousness " and " another italy , " according to the <unk> .
the great unknown is the <unk> of his team .

a russian scientist has assisted an iranian nuclear programme
a russian scientist , <unk> <unk> , assisted iran to develop a <unk> <unk> with a nuclear weapon , confirmed on monday an american agency <unk> in the field of atomic hazard .
the institute of science of international safety <unk> ) bases itself on the recent report from the international atomic safety agency ( <unk> ) and other documents from this <unk> agency , to identify this researcher .
last week , <unk> announced its serious disquiet concerning a " possible military dimension " of the iranian nuclear programme .
according to <unk> drawing largely on <unk> documents , <unk> <unk> , born in 0000 , worked for 00 years from the ' <unk> <unk> , in a soviet military nuclear centre in <unk> ( <unk> ) , and was involved in the manufacture by explosion of synthetic <unk> .
in 0000 or 0000 he left the centre to establish a company producing " nano - <unk> " in kiev .
the economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the iranian <unk> in ukraine in 0000 .
he then cooperated on an iranian programme from 0000 to 0000 , before returning to russia .
in its last report , <unk> mentions " strong indications that the development by iran " of a system of nuclear detonation " was aided by the work of a foreign expert , who not only knew this technique well , but who also informed the agency that he had worked for most of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin . "
anti - <unk> crimes have increased by 00 %
between 0000 and 0000 , anti - <unk> crimes increase by almost 00 % , whilst during the same period other forms of racial and religious violence had fallen slightly , or had not changed , according to <unk> statistics published on monday .
according to these figures , the total number of cases of violence against <unk> moved from 000 in 0000 to 000 in 0000 , equal to an increase of 00 % , as against an increase of 00 % of cases of violence against catholics , a fall of 0 % of attacks on jews and a global increase of 00 % in anti - religious crimes .
the global number of hate crimes increased very slightly to 0 000 cases , of which 00,0 % were motivated by racial differences and 00 % by religious differences , according to <unk> .
" after a decrease in 0000 , it is disturbing to see these crimes increasing again , stressed the rights of man organisation , human rights first , " the increase of cases of anti - <unk> violence is particularly significant , " added the organisation in a <unk> .
" human rights first has long stressed that acts of violence against <unk> , as well as all forms of hate crime , must be regarded as serious violations of human rights , " adds one of the managers of the organisation , paul <unk> .
" the american government can and must do more to deal with his abuse , he adds , judging that this could be due to the <unk> of police reports on hate crimes . "
" hate crime " in federal law , is a legacy from the period of struggle for civil rights .
this legislation was passed after the death of martin luther king to punish acts of violence linked to race , colour of skin , religion , origin and now sexual orientation .
<unk> modifies its platform and resembles <unk>
on monday , the <unk> site <unk> introduced changes in the presentation of its platform , to allow its users , in particular , to observe the activity of those whom they are monitoring , which makes its service resemble that of <unk> .
a new <unk> " activity " and another " name " make it possible to follow more <unk> and directly the activity of other " <unk> , " the internet navigators whose messages are monitored ( " <unk> " ) and of those who monitor you .
this enables one to know if they cause messages to be monitored , if they subscribe new accounts , if they have favourite messages , etc.
this new <unk> formula was tested " on a small percentage of users in august " before being <unk> to the entire network on monday , indicated a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> , which has been known so far for being rather <unk> , and for its use of somewhat <unk> terms ( <unk> for re - <unk> someone else 's message , <unk> for recommending following other users ) , much to the delight of experienced users , is thus opening itself to a wider audience by offering a user experience closer to those of popular social networks <unk> and google + .
on the network , users debated this innovation via " <unk> " on internet .
" it is useless , <unk> and resembles <unk> excessively "
" the functionality activity will help me to monitor better certain elements of my <unk> flow , " sent <unk> .
austria
<unk> of a budgetary " golden rule " in the constitution
the government of the great social democratic / christian democratic coalition in power in austria decided on tuesday to write a budgetary " golden rule " into the constitution , in order to reduce public deficits and so avoid a possible downgrading by rating agencies of austria 's sovereign credit <unk> ( triple a ) .
it was the social - democratic chancellor his <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who announced this decision at the end of a meeting of the council of ministers , with the austrian public debt at 00,0 % , much higher than the norm of a maximum of 00 % set by the treaty of maastricht , but below the public debt of countries like italy , greece or spain .
" if the solvency of austria had not fallen by a single notch , from <unk> to <unk> + , we would have to pay three thousand million euros of interest more every year , " argued the vice - chancellor and christian democratic foreign minister , michael <unk> .
austria thus complies with a request from the brussels summit of member - states of eurozone on 00 october ; the heads of state and government requested a reduction by the end of 0000 of public deficits and a return to balanced public accounts in the constitution or in a law to the same effect .
the <unk> adopted by the austrian government approach the " german model , " being the first european country to adopt this " rule . "
by 0000 , the public structural deficit must fall by 0.00 % of the <unk> ) and from 0000 , the structural public deficit of the austrian federal state must not exceed <unk> % of <unk> in any year , whilst the länder , as well as communities , must submit balanced budgets .
the objective is that of making public debt fall below the 00 % criterion fixed by the treaty of maastricht by 0000/0000 .
<unk> <unk>
threatens fresh intervention on the exchange market
the japanese prime minister , <unk> <unk> , warned on tuesday that the japanese authorities would again intervene in the exchanges market if the value of the yen continued to rise .
" we would intervene as we did the last time , if we found excessive volatility in the rate of exchange of the yen , explained <unk> <unk> to the senate .
on tuesday , the yen rose to near historical levels , causing the japanese authorities to intervene on 00 october .
on that date , <unk> sold the yen against the dollar on a massive scale in order to cut the value of the japanese currency , which was setting a new record of strength since 0000 .
but the yen had risen regularly since then , stimulated by purchases by investors who regard it as a " shelter " in these uncertain times of worldwide economic slowdown and the debt crisis in europe .
on tuesday , the dollar fell below 00 yen and the euro fell under the symbolic bar of 000 yen , close to levels which triggered the last intervention .
prior to the financial crisis of 0000-0000 , the dollar was about 000 yen and the euro over 000 yen .
this rise of the japanese currency damages japanese exports , because it makes japanese products more expensive and reduces the value of income of japanese firms from abroad , when converted into the national currency .
" japan is fighting to <unk> itself " since the earthquake and the tsunami on 00 march , which devastated the region of <unk> ( north - east ) , stressed <unk> <unk> who fears that this rise of the yen does not kill the fragile embryonic recovery .
the world 's third biggest economic power has resumed growth in the third quarter <unk> , 0 % compared with the previous quarter - for the first time for a year , thanks to a rise in exports and consumption of households affected by the catastrophe .
but the prime minister felt that the high price of the yen did to reflect " japan 's economic fundamentals . "
the minister of finance , <unk> <unk> , called on the bank of japan ( <unk> ) , which on tuesday opened a two - day meeting of its monetary policy council , to take every necessary step to weaken the yen .
but the deputy <unk> of the institution , <unk> <unk> , warned that the bank of japan had already taken steps the " appropriate steps " stating that no additional monetary flexibility was to be expected on wednesday
since its last meeting at the end of october , the issuing institution increased by 0.000 million yen ( 00 thousand million euro 's ) worth of <unk> <unk> purchases , raising the ceiling to <unk> thousand million yen ( 000 thousand million euros ) , which it is devoting to the purchase of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market .
eurozone :
the rates are <unk> , the stock exchanges are wavering
the risk of contagion of the debt crisis is undermining european indices .
despite the appointment of new heads of government in greece and in italy and better growth figures in france and in germany , the rates in fragile countries continue to rise .
still worried about the stability of eurozone , european exchanges have entered a little further into the negative area on this tuesday 00 november .
in paris , at 00 a.m. , the <unk> 00 lost <unk> % to end at 0.000 points .
the <unk> at frankfurt fell <unk> % and london <unk> % .
" with the new tensions about the yield of loans of eurozone states in difficulties , the share markets worldwide <unk> to lose a part of their recent gains . "
" nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of contagion , " explains terry <unk> , an institutional broker at <unk> markets quoted by <unk> .
the <unk> exchange closed with a fall of <unk> % , suffering fresh doubts of market participants on the subject of the capacity of europe to contain the debt crisis .
" japan , like the rest of the world has its eyes <unk> on europe and the exchanges will chase one another in a corridor of narrow variations as investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilised , " states <unk> <unk> , fund manager at <unk> investment management .
this re - emergence of disquiet about the future of eurozone <unk> the single currency , which has continued to fall on tuesday .
the euro is reaching its lowest level for a month and a half .
towards 00 a.m. the european currency is worth <unk> dollars , having fallen by <unk> % .
according to brokers , it fell after the party of the chancellor angela merkel , the cdu meeting on monday adopted a motion , envisaging , in particular , the possibility of a country in difficulty leaving the eurozone without also leaving the european union .
italian and spanish rates substantially above 0 %
the borrowing rates of italy and spain remain at very disquieting levels .
this tuesday morning the yield of italian 00 - year <unk> attained <unk> % , that of spanish ones of the same maturity date , <unk> % .
these tensions of the rates of interest of southern countries , but also france , continue to feed the apprehensions of participants .
the head of the future italian government , mario <unk> asked the markets for time to restore the situation in an italy threatened by <unk> by the weight of its debt .
the new greek prime minister lucas <unk> affirmed that the implementation of decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 00 october would be " the principal task " of his government .
spain finds itself in the line of fire by the markets ahead of the parliamentary elections on sunday .
the spread of the rate between 00 - year german and spanish <unk> has reached a new historically high level .
awaiting the growth figures of eurozone
france has recorded an economic growth of <unk> % in the third quarter , a little better than the expected <unk> % , due to increased household consumption .
the <unk> nevertheless revised downwards the figure for the second quarter , with a fall of <unk> % of the gross internal product ( <unk> ) instead of stagnation .
and it is really the fourth quarter , which most <unk> the economists .
germany for its part , <unk> recorded a growth of <unk> % for the same period .
a first estimate in respect of the whole eurozone is expected at 00 <unk> m , the european commission having warned against the risk of a new recession .
energy policy :
facts must prevail over dogmas
if there is a topic which cannot be dealt with via short - term considerations , or under the stress of emotion , it is energy policy .
the availability and cost of electricity affect directly the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies .
it is healthy that an electoral rendezvous should be an occasion for reflecting on such stakes and the place occupied by nuclear power .
the debate will not be fruitful , unless it <unk> all the economic , social and environmental consequences of the proposed options .
the french must base their opinion on the objective facts of rational data .
now that we are 0 thousand million human beings on the planet , demographic development will involve a <unk> of demand for electricity by 0000 , unless a huge proportion of the world 's population is deprived of a vital element .
during the same period , it will become necessary to <unk> the increasing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity permanently without forgetting the overriding need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases to fight climatic imbalance , a subject which has vanished from the ecological debate .
the <unk> accident does not modify any of these parameters .
this is why germany is isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear energy .
this is not the case of belgium , which <unk> its decision to the need to find a source able to replace nuclear energy , or that of switzerland , which intends to build only the most modern ones .
on the other hand , great britain , finland , poland , the czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil to quote only a few , pursue their projects with determination .
the united states , decided after <unk> to add a unit to their range by resuming the construction of a centre , which was interrupted after the three mile island accident .
although the german model based on renewable energies is sometimes quoted as an example , the reality contradicts that argument .
the choice of berlin will result in a rise of the price of electricity , an increased energy dependence aggravated by increased recourse to imported gas , in particular from russia , a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and of coal centres .
in a few months all these adverse effects will already be felt .
the case of denmark should be considered .
champion of europe in the construction of turbines , from which it draws 00 % of its electricity , it is also one of the largest users of coal and of gas due to <unk> wind ; due to which its carbon dioxide emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 00 % and 00 % higher than the european average .
on the other hand , thanks to the <unk> of energy policy , our neighbours pay 00 % more for their electricity than french households .
since in the worldwide economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a stake in the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory , french companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in europe .
due to this , any significant fall in the cost of nuclear energy would bring about a big rise of cost of electricity , which would render illusory the fine declarations on re - industrialisation of our country and the protection of purchasing power .
a price , which a large majority of the french refuse to pay , all the more so , since they do not object to this form of energy in principle .
it should be recalled that the energy policy of our country made it possible to establish an industrial line of 000 000 direct jobs and 000 000 resulting ones .
strongly export - oriented , it attracts a <unk> of specialised <unk> 's in international markets and creates many jobs , which cannot be moved elsewhere .
if france decided to abandon nuclear power , she would sacrifice a large number of these <unk> 's and lose the annual 0 thousand million euro 's worth of french exports of nuclear equipment and services .
what <unk> would recommend a <unk> designed to function for sixty years , if the decline of its manufacture was <unk> ?
to solve the energy equation , it must be admitted that there is no miraculous or diabolical source of production of electricity .
the development by <unk> of low carbon dioxide emission solutions , nuclear and renewable , bears witness to the complementary nature sources of energy .
for nuclear energy to maintain the highest level of safety , is absolutely vital .
in france , we have a safety authority , which exercises an <unk> and transparent control of existing generation centres such as <unk> .
our teams , whose professionalism is recognised , are accustomed to the same safety - related obsession .
in a space of 00 years , the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents .
only one , three mile island , occurred under normal operating conditions , but without any human or environmental consequences .
at <unk> , the design of the reactor and <unk> human error brought about the drama .
at <unk> , some people appear to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude , which caused the death of tens of thousands of people .
the nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident , as it has from its two predecessors .
the fruit of this step and of cooperation between safety authorities , the operators and french and german <unk> , the <unk> presents a design enabling it to resist such phenomena .
since it is being considered by all <unk> wishing to construct a generation centre , a decision to construct it at <unk> would be a magnificent gift to the competitors of <unk> and <unk> by clearing their way to <unk> the leadership of the unavoidable development of nuclear energy .
it is essential and legitimate to look for the best fan of energies for our country , but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion , dogmas and partisan manoeuvres to dominate the debate , which is so decisive for the economic , social and financial situation of our country .
is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy ?
immigration policy under nicolas sarkozy was criticised from various aspects a congestion of police , legal and administrative services subjected to a policy of numbers and the compatibility of that policy with the self - proclaimed status of the country as the country of french human rights .
more recently , it is administrative harassment of foreign students , which is topical , with the minister of the interior ( " <unk> " on 00 may ) declaring that france " does not need foreign talent , <unk> and waiters . "
but it is only rarely analysed from the economic viewpoint .
there is a lot of consensus between the left and the right on this subject .
on the right , the tone was set by jacques chirac , who declared in 0000 that " 000,000 unemployed would not become a problem in a country with 0 million of foreign workers , " and on the left by michel rocard explaining in 0000 that france " cannot accommodate all the world 's misery . "
the only difference , the degree of generosity
in 0000 , the fear of invasion of the national territory by <unk> of polish plumbers was felt both on the left and on the right .
both sides see immigrants as a burden on the french economy and on french society .
the only difference <unk> in the degree of generosity , which one <unk> to grant to immigrants .
in his programme , françois <unk> confines himself to <unk> , saying that co - development would allow our immigration problem to be solved . "
this notion of immigration being a burden and a problem , may be an electoral asset , but it is economically very costly .
as the economists <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , remind us in a recent book <unk> the most recent knowledge of immigration ( exceptional people : how migration shaped our world and will define our future , <unk> 0000 , <unk> university press , 000 <unk> . ) , there is wide consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , wages and employment in countries , which admit immigrants .
<unk> immigration leads to <unk> growth and harms employment .
fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the notion that they are liable to replace <unk> workers , in particular unskilled ones , exerting downward pressure on wages .
but experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more complementary to , rather than replacements of , local labour , exercising trades in which there is a shortage of local labour .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors , which do not attract local labour and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment .
a positive effect on wages
in the same way as a <unk> would find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of <unk> , the <unk> existing between <unk> and immigrants bring it about that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the pay of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> has calculated that a rise of 0 % in the migratory flow causes an increase of between <unk> and <unk> % in real long - term pay .
and does so without taking into account the fact that the diversity contributed by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth ( a large proportion of <unk> immigrants are among american nobel <unk> , whilst google , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> were all founded by immigrants ) .
migrants are also net <unk> to social systems , <unk> 0 % of the total budgets of european countries .
<unk> world labour organisation estimates that for example in germany , an immigrant arriving at the age of 00 , will make a net contribution ( receipts less expenditure ) of an average of 000,000 euros to public budgets during his lifetime .
nicolas sarkozy wished at the start of his mandate to look for missing points of growth " with the <unk> . "
the <unk> in question , intended to serve to dissuade immigrants , had precisely the opposite effect .
europe invented democracy , thinks in terms of european democracy
democracy is a precious possession ; it is also a fragile one .
the european continent should be able to remember that having invented it in athens over two thousand years ago , it experienced during the <unk> century the tragedies of the world war , of <unk> , the holocaust , the <unk> , but also franco in spain , <unk> in portugal and the <unk> in greece .
some believed that it was enough for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies , to exercise the vote , and to do so as directly as possible .
it is known that since the time of <unk> it was a matter of <unk> of thinking .
universal suffrage , in order to be the sine qua non of democracy , is not enough and can actually become a " tool of oppression " as once said the republican philosopher <unk> <unk> .
no , democracy requires a lot more , a public space , a public spirit , values , an organisation , a separation and control of powers , education , the <unk> , economic and social solidarity , justice .
the european crisis , which we are passing through , is an economic crisis , but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy .
in this respect , the <unk> of a true - false greek referendum will have a double <unk> value , that of a need of a powerful reversal of policy , but also that of the worrying sentiment of its impossibility and of its <unk> .
this ambivalence must be thought through , in order that it can be bypassed .
the truth is that the lines of the forefront of democratic struggle have now moved , and that for many , the republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction .
we have nothing to gain from demanding a <unk> of national referendums organised as required and in a confused sequence .
the " free hand " of an absolute european <unk> , or a jump with tied feet into the nationalist void ; what a choice for a citizen !
no , we do not want the <unk> of a <unk> , but an exercise , joint , <unk> and ongoing , of choice and of democracy , this time on european level .
there are no crises in greece , italy , spain or portugal and one would not know where to stop <unk> them , because there is only a single crisis and that is in europe .
it is the whole of europe , which <unk> to the dictates of the markets and of rating agencies , who suffer from their <unk> and a lack of solidarity .
it is all europe , which is <unk> on the international scene .
there is disquiet about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but it is the entire europe , which is gradually losing its sovereignty , and with its each of its nations .
the urgency concerns the return to popular sovereignty , the direction of the european project .
because it is by all working together , that europeans will be able reduce the weight of their individual debts , to free themselves from the markets and to prepare for the future by investing in it .
emerging from the crisis will entail decisions on european level , which cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy without leading us into disaster .
after having long fought this proposal by specialists and of jacques delors , the whole world now calls for a european economic government .
let is be so .
but the idea without stronger economic , political and democratic integration and lived in such by citizens , would be a fresh <unk> and a new impasse .
we must launch a new stage of european construction .
to establish the republic in france , it was necessary to " make " <unk> .
the revolution of interests would not be enough .
this lesson remains valid .
we must construct a europe integrated on economic level .
this can only be done by constructing a more democratic europe on political level , a real popular european sovereignty .
to make europe , let us make europeans .
<unk> maps without contacts become generalised
the worldwide <unk> map room opens on tuesday at <unk> near paris , in an optimistic atmosphere .
the year 0000 should actually end on an 00 % rise of worldwide sales of <unk> ( bank cards , telephones with a <unk> card . . . ) , with over 0 thousand million units , according to <unk> .
the most important sector is that of <unk> technology , which enables paying for common transport or paying for purchases simply by passing the card over a <unk> .
this year , 000 million of <unk> <unk> cards should be sold worldwide , as against 000 millions a year earlier !
their share will progress in 0000 ( 000 million units expected ) and represent almost 00 % of the global market of <unk> cards ( 0,000 million cards ) .
for a long time , lagging behind the asia - pacific region , europe is now gaining ground in <unk> payment .
some 00 million visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 00 000 payment <unk> accept them .
in france , the start is more modest ; <unk> <unk> visa card are in use .
but the large stores are installing <unk> slots .
this year , <unk> issued <unk> million <unk> <unk> .
to achieve higher speeds , it is now necessary to equip their clients .
" two large french establishments have undertaken to distribute systematically in future to their clients , bank cards equipped for <unk> use , <unk> gérard <unk> , director - general of visa europe france .
banks are testing payment by mobile telephone
but this is only a first stage of the future mode of payment , namely , the mobile telephone .
few apparatus are at present equipped with <unk> technology ( near field communication , essential for implementing these transactions .
" they have been delayed .
" but they should really take wing next year . "
" we are counting on a worldwide sale of 00 to 000 million units in 0000 , explains <unk> <unk> , president of <unk> .
but the banks are forging ahead .
yesterday , <unk> <unk> announced a test to run from next december to june in <unk> .
the <unk> of some 000 clients and collaborators are going to be equipped to authorise <unk> payment .
the <unk> has a similar project in strasbourg and in marseille .
and the <unk> <unk> also said yesterday that it is preparing the market launch of an offer enabling its clients to pay via their <unk> .
the terrorist front extends from sahara to nigeria
paris is <unk> by links between the islamic maghreb and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
suspected for a long time , the links between the terrorist group al-qaida in the islamic maghreb ( <unk> ) and the nigerian <unk> <unk> <unk> have been confirmed .
on sunday , the <unk> deputy foreign minister , <unk> <unk> , even stated that <unk> is now certain .
" the manner in which the two organisations operate and the reports of secret services show that there is a lot of cooperation , he explained without elaborating .
paris appears to make a similar analysis .
the inquiry into the kidnapping of two <unk> in niger in january discovered two bridges .
the men kidnapped men in a restaurant in <unk> by relatives of <unk> , antoine de <unk> and <unk> <unk> had to be killed on the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by special french forces .
among the <unk> left behind by the action , french and nigerian <unk> found several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists .
terrorist axis
the analysis of calls exchanged indicates several interlocutors based in mali , in niger and in nigeria .
according to radio france <unk> ( <unk> ) , two numbers interest the <unk> in particular ; one leads to a nigerian who lived for a long time in <unk> , a town in northern nigeria , the cradle of <unk> <unk> and the other to a man said to be close to <unk> and to the <unk> .
" this is an advance , but it is undoubtedly necessary to await more exact <unk> before talking about operational cooperation between <unk> and <unk> <unk> . "
" but it is possible . "
" it has been known for years that the <unk> benefits from outside financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active , says <unk> <unk> , a nigerian researcher .
in recent months , this support became more and more evident from the developments and statements by <unk> <unk> and from its methods of operation , which increasingly include resort to <unk> and to increasingly complex explosive engines of the same type as those used by <unk> .
the international community , starting with washington , is now exerting pressure on <unk> to take into account the problems caused by <unk> <unk> .
nigerian authorities have in fact long considered the group to be a community of enlightened persons not worthy of interest .
rapid success
founded in 0000 at <unk> around a mosque , a school and a fundamentalist <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> - which means in <unk> " with western education " is a criminal , who promotes the installation of an islamic <unk> in the <unk> north of nigeria .
in this poor region , the association is enjoying rapid success .
it is politicised and demands rigid respect of <unk> , whilst its militants engage in a struggle with the <unk> central government .
the latter target primarily churches , bars and administrations .
in 0000 , the militants of <unk> <unk> showed themselves particularly active , <unk> attacks on police establishments .
the reaction of <unk> is , as usual , without light and <unk> .
the army <unk> a town and leaves 000 dead behind .
<unk> <unk> , arrested alive , was killed in prison .
now the <unk> will become radicalised and will leave its northern <unk> .
last christmas it claimed an attack , which left 00 dead at jos and then more at <unk> .
in june at <unk> , <unk> <unk> takes a secured police <unk> during a suicide attack , its first .
in august , the local united nations headquarters will be its first international target .
the creation of a terrorist axis in africa , which will move from mauritania to <unk> via nigeria , now <unk> all security specialists .
now that <unk> has invested mali and niger and the <unk> of <unk> operate in <unk> , <unk> <unk> appears to be a new menace in the continent .
last week during an interview in nigeria with president <unk> <unk> , alain <unk> warned against <unk> <unk> and declared himself ready to share all intelligence .
the world according to the republican presidential candidates
concerning china , iran , aid to israel , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> compete in simplification and a lack of knowledge .
can an america weakened by crisis , lead a complex world by simple and indeed , simplistic , ideas ?
to listen to republican presidential candidates , the electors might believe it .
for some days , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and the others multiply resounding and abbreviated foreign policy declarations , which are traditionally a republican strong suit .
concerning china , iran and aid to israel , the slogans , are often <unk> together .
<unk> <unk> , the best placed for nomination of the " grand old party , " threatened to <unk> the chinese before the <unk> and to accuse them of " manipulation of their currency , a sensitive subject in an america <unk> by the migration of whole sections of its industry to asia .
so much the worse if this should trigger a trade war , he said .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> 's former ambassador to china and the only candidate with a vision of a sophisticated foreign policy , has failed to suppress an attitude which <unk> the emotions .
he called for a <unk> , but a constructive , dialogue with <unk> ( the current position of <unk> ) .
but <unk> , who is <unk> at the bottom of the polls , remains inaudible .
in the style of <unk>
<unk> also promised military strikes on iran , if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme .
" if i am elected , i will stop iran , he <unk> . "
" if <unk> is re - elected , they will have the bomb . "
<unk> also promised to increase military aid to israel , accusing <unk> of failing in his obligations to <unk> that partner .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the second best - placed candidate , <unk> an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files .
recently , he called for opposition to the chinese military threat , because <unk> is trying to develop a nuclear capacity - apparently unaware of the fact that china has <unk> it since 0000 !
the texas <unk> <unk> <unk> , who supports israel and wants military strikes against iran , says that he is ready to involve the usa army in mexico against the drug cartels .
resort to the torture of terrorist suspects prohibited by <unk> in 0000 , is also recommended by <unk> , <unk> and by the candidate <unk> <unk> .
one is far away from the 0000 republican candidate john <unk> , a foreign policy <unk> .
the opponents of the current president reply that <unk> also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war .
they recall that <unk> himself was an amateur and that he had to water down his wine concerning anti - terrorism .
they insist with good reason on the <unk> of his naive dialogue with iran on the premature departure of the " boys " from iraq , his <unk> in libya labelling him weak .
but the attack is not so easy .
the population judges as positive <unk> 's the balance of national security , which eliminated bin laden .
since iraq , it <unk> military interventions , which run into <unk> .
and in arguing that it is necessary to <unk> america economically to revive its leadership , <unk> is right .
the north stream , a new portal for the entry of russian gas into europe
the north stream <unk> connecting western europe and russia directly along the bottom of the baltic sea , has been commissioned .
it is scheduled to supply gas for the equivalent of 00 million homes .
gazprom , the giant russian gas producer , wanted to celebrate the event with a " <unk> . "
over 000 guests including four heads of state and of government took part last tuesday on the shores of the baltic , between an <unk> performance and a fine <unk> , in the <unk> of north stream , the new <unk> , which directly links russia and germany under the sea .
symbolically , the german chancellor angela merkel , the russian president <unk> <unk> , the french prime minister françois <unk> and his dutch opposite number mark <unk> jointly turned the <unk> controlling the entry of russian gas into the west european network .
with this new <unk> , 00,0 thousand million additional <unk> metres of russian gas will arrive every year in western europe via a first pipeline of 0 000 km linking the region of saint petersburg to the land of <unk> - <unk> .
a second pipeline is due to be ready by the end of 0000 , making it possible to deliver a total of 00 thousand million <unk> metres of gas , the equivalent of the entire french consumption .
and the possibility of constructing a third pipeline of the same course is already under discussion .
for gazprom , the completion on time of this huge project is a victory .
the project was <unk> <unk> for by poland and the baltic states .
the north stream will in fact allow gas to be delivered directly to germany , avoiding any passage via a third country ( poland or the ukraine ) .
these two countries will lose some of their power : it will become more difficult for them to influence russia by threatening to close access to west european markets .
at the most critical point of the debate , warsaw did not hesitate to compare north stream new " german - soviet pact , " referring to the alliance between hitler and <unk> to occupy poland in 0000 .
that is to say that the topic is politically sensitive .
by supporting this russian project , western europe is gaining greater security for its supplies .
but at the price of depriving europe of energy , since the project has created a breach between eastern and western europe .
russia has succeeded in less than five years , in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between russia and the the rich western countries , which consume large quantities of gas , and whose deposits are declining .
" this <unk> is a component of partnership with russia , it is a new <unk> which links us <unk> , " confirmed françois <unk> <unk> the <unk> , demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are both politically and economically important .
all this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the heads of gazprom , present in large numbers at <unk> , the point of arrival of the gas .
the construction of this <unk> is also a technical exploit .
the <unk> pipeline is made of steel embedded in concrete , in order to protect it from ships ' anchors .
<unk> rests on the bottom of the sea , at an average depth of 000 metres .
to construct it , it was necessary to avoid <unk> dating back to the second world war .
" a hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a <unk> , " says jens <unk> , spokesman of north stream company .
it was also necessary to multiply steps of protecting the fauna and the flora .
the pipeline is a long metal <unk> , of weight equivalent to that of 000 <unk> <unk> , with no breaks throughout its length , no valves and no maintenance stations .
a control platform was provided on the level of sweden , but the project managers abandoned it since the swedes were not keen on seeing a russian state company becoming permanently on its shores .
" in case of accident we stop the passage of gas for at least one minute , " states jens <unk> .
in the case of a leak , the gas contained in the <unk> therefore <unk> into the air .
but this is thought to be unlikely by the <unk> who provided <unk> to leak only every 000 000 years .
the surveillance of the state of the <unk> is provided by an <unk> <unk> , pulled by a ship for outside observation , as well as by an apparatus circulating within the <unk> .
being cigar - shaped , it is introduced inside the 0 - metre wide pipeline , and it is pushed along by the gas .
on arrival after 0 complete days of travel at a speed of 0 metres per second , it delivers precise information concerning any metal <unk> .
the <unk> was designed to work for 00 years without any need for even the smallest repair .
the gas circulation is implemented simply by its pressure .
this is 000 bar on leaving and 000 bar on arrival .
five companies combined their forces to implement this project .
the leader remains gazprom , which holds 00 % of the <unk> .
the others are the german companies e. on and <unk> ( 00.0 % each ) and the dutch <unk> and the french group gdf suez ( 0 % each ) .
these five companies have created a joint enterprise called north stream , delegated to construct and to operate the <unk> .
it has its headquarters at <unk> in switzerland , where taxation is particularly favourable .
gazprom next leased to this company for twenty renewable years , the entire capacity of gas transport .
" gazprom will pay for the total capacity , whatever may be the quantity of gas actually transported , " states jens <unk> .
the financing of the construction of the <unk> was provided to the extent of 00 % by the shareholders and of 00 % by bank loans .
the total cost of the works will be 0.0 thousand million euros for the two pipelines .
the gdf suez investment will be about 000 millions .
but the minority shareholders are certain to recover their costs , since gazprom assumes the entire risk .
the <unk> emerges from the baltic sea at <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
0.0 metre high valves form the gas exit .
<unk> measure pressure , temperature and the specific <unk> of arriving gas before being transferred into german <unk> .
since last tuesday , the terminal has been receiving one million <unk> metres of russian gas every hour .
at full capacity , this will be 0 million an hour and in 0000 , 0 million .
<unk> , a brand card .
created fifteen years ago by an italian company , <unk> will restore the taste of writing .
it is a <unk> of adventure , of hours sent in writing by a the light of a <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is easily recognised , by its black <unk> cover , its <unk> , its broken white pages , as if aged over time .
nevertheless , the <unk> <unk> as we know it today , was born in 0000 .
the italian company <unk> <unk> , based in milan , decided to launch a <unk> <unk> .
maria <unk> , then a consultant of the company , has assumed responsibility for the launch of the new product .
the <unk> draws its inspiration from an old production technique , the <unk> skin which means <unk> cotton used for covering benches , for example .
this type of <unk> is said to be highly <unk> by <unk> and travellers .
" <unk> has been updated to meet current taste for an old and forgotten object , which was an <unk> artists ' <unk> up to the <unk> century , " related maria <unk> , who has since become the manager of the brand name at <unk> <unk> .
success is there .
between 0000 and 0000 , sales rose by 00 % to reach 00.0 million units .
one has travelled far from the production of the first years , when only 0000 <unk> were made .
<unk> is crossing the italian frontiers and is exporting to 00 countries , from france to the usa .
it is difficult to establish a profile of the typical purchaser , because the <unk> attracts equally a <unk> , a student and a professional .
<unk> consumers are cosmopolitan , open - minded and cultivated .
the small italian company , which had only 00 employees at the start , now has almost 000 and two offices , one in milan and the other in new york .
its distributes its <unk> to <unk> libraries , small shops in town centres and has succeeded in becoming well known .
" we followed the spirit of the times and this need for new means of writing , notwithstanding the rise of e-mail , " explains maria <unk> .
this cultural signature <unk> the development of <unk> ; recently , the brand launched an exhibition " <unk> " where architects or artists <unk> their own <unk> .
in august , it also launched a <unk> pattern cover on the occasion of the film festival in <unk> .
exploiting its success and the cultural <unk> , <unk> diversified its products to include <unk> , pens , computer bags . the brand includes every kind of support .
a success , which aroused envy ; in the autumn of 0000 , <unk> <unk> was bought by the investment fund <unk> capital europe , now <unk> capital , to write a new page in the history of <unk> .
why is the rate of unemployment of <unk> workers so high ?
some 00 % of <unk> persons are looking for work .
the 00th week for the employment of the <unk> starts today .
despite a public voluntary policy introduced in 0000 , the rate of unemployment of the <unk> is still twice as high as the average , namely 00 % , versus 0 % for the population as a whole .
discouraging ?
" no , stresses <unk> <unk> , director - general of adapt , the association which <unk> the week for the employment of the <unk> . "
" the progress achieved since 00 years ago is considerable . "
" at that time the rate of unemployment was not <unk> but <unk> as high . "
" there is however still a huge amount to do . "
it must be said that for the <unk> , the obstacles to obtaining employment are still many .
they are rather old : 00 % are over 00 ( 00 % on average ) .
they have rather a low level of qualifications ; 00 % do not have the " bac " and out of the 0.0 million students in higher education only 00 000 are <unk> .
lastly , long - term unemployment is very widespread , being 00 % for the <unk> versus 00 % on an average .
briefly , all these are criteria which greatly complicate a return to employment and which constitute the <unk> of the problem , " according to christian <unk> , director - general of <unk> , an association created in 0000 to help companies to recruit <unk> workers .
here are some of the brakes .
it is hardly necessary to speak about <unk> , which do change , but too slowly .
a study carried out in april by the association <unk> - <unk> <unk> la <unk> showed that the managers questioned had a low level of knowledge of handicap , " with an " over - representation of persons in wheelchairs , <unk> or intellectually deficient persons . "
result - private companies employing over 00 persons are still far from achieving the objective of employing the 0 % of <unk> workers , fixed by a law dating back to 0000 .
the latter known figures dating to 0000 have a ratio of 0.0 % .
" we are now on around 0 % , " says pierre <unk> , director - general of the <unk> , the organisation responsible for collecting contributions from companies which do not observe this law .
proof : the number of " taxed " establishments , like the sums paid , have fallen between 0000 and 0000 , from 00 000 to 00 000 structures ( and from 000 to 000 million euros ) .
" the law of 0000 , which raised the contributions , created a strong pressure on companies , explains pierre <unk> . "
" but this improvement also reflects a rise of consciousness , in particular within large groups . "
according to the ministry of employment , only 00 % of establishments employing between 00 and 00 <unk> persons , versus 00 % of companies employing between 000 and 000 persons .
chance : " what happiness "
before facing the <unk> on tuesday evening ( 00.00 <unk> ) eden hazard and <unk> <unk> did not hide the pleasure , which this friendly match gave to them .
we do not go so far as to say that there was connivance between them , but the image is symbolic .
sitting side by side on the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> de france , <unk> <unk> and eden hazard made peace .
five months following the gesture of <unk> of his <unk> against turkey , the belgian <unk> can only be praised .
" i am very pleased with eden , his progress and the fact that he is belgian . "
" i want to go forward , <unk> the <unk> .
in contrast between his respective club and selection performances , " it is of a piece if it is justified . "
" at <unk> , i am there all the year round , which is not the case of belgium . "
" i must take my marks . "
selected to play against romania on friday evening in its match against france , hazard went to saint - <unk> in order at last to " <unk> . "
not however forgetting the notion of " pleasing . "
he encouraged the <unk> from the age of 0 years and the victorious campaigns of 0000 and 0000 .
" i always supported them , he <unk> .
this necessarily <unk> in strengthening even more the particular character of this match .
all the more so , since opposite are <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( rami ) , " he recalls .
" we just crossed each others path . "
" to be able to play against them , that is pure happiness ! "
with <unk> , <unk> recalled " pride . "
" pride " of playing in " a <unk> match . "
" pride " also in <unk> <unk> " neighbour " that france has " become again a very high level team " only a little more than one year after the <unk> of <unk> .
" <unk> <unk> was a <unk> , he <unk> .
now that belgium will miss the next euro , the <unk> will share an aircraft with the <unk> management ... brazil in 0000 .
" our little belgians become big , " he stressed .
" one is building something , the players are ambitious , they are hungry . "
" you will realise this during the <unk> to come . including that against france .
portugal is very confident
the portugal of paulo <unk> starts its return match against bosnia ( <unk> ) very <unk> , this tuesday in lisbon .
on their way there , both teams appeared to lack realism .
" at the end of these 00 minutes , we will be a happy team and most importantly , a happy country . "
paulo <unk> already sees himself in poland and in the ukraine .
for him there is not a shadow of a doubt , the selection , with which he has been at odds since september 0000 , will qualify for euro 0000 .
portugal is only 00 minutes away from happiness .
but there is match to play and an opponent , bosnia to conquer .
in view of the ( 0-0 ) , on friday in the hell of <unk> it is clear that the games are not over .
whilst portugal dominated the match for over one hour , it was not able to reach this precious target , which would have <unk> it .
" it is a good result , which nevertheless involves a certain risk "
but on their side , in their <unk> <unk> de la <unk> in lisbon , the portuguese are convinced that they are playing in front of a public which must be enthusiastic , even if the match is very close , " said an optimistic , but lucid , <unk>
" we are expecting a very close match , but we are convinced that we can win , declared the portuguese <unk> aged 00 .
" we continue to have a 00 % chance of being at euro 0000 , " even under the successor of carlos <unk> .
the zero taken on friday from bosnia obliges the portuguese to win .
a zero may be sufficient for the <unk> .
" it is a good result , which nevertheless carries some risk , regrets <unk> .
" we are going to play a team which has many technical qualities and which has players <unk> many individual qualities , " he added .
as already in <unk> , the portuguese would plan to exert <unk> pressure on the <unk> from the start , to " give them no time to think . "
a good idea , provided that it will , prove realistic this time .
