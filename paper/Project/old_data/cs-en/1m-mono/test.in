what will they do ? <unk> lacks knowledge of both <unk> and <unk> bars in prague
new <unk> of <unk> will most probably have to overcome certain language barriers to understand their old - new colleagues from <unk> in prague council and municipal council .
<unk> " tested " the social democrat members of the new council in terms of the well - established <unk> that originated in the town hall during the few last years , when prague was ruled by the current coalition partners .
coded vocabulary that was established by prague political elite during the previous era of the mayor <unk> <unk> , describes some of the most famous persons , situations and affairs in the city .
surprisingly , it turned out that the new council members do not understand the well - known concepts .
at least they say so .
" who is <unk> ? "
" i really do not know . "
" i <unk> rather a <unk> in prague politics , " responded <unk> <unk> , the <unk> for culture , to the test of " <unk> " vocabulary .
and even though he is a political <unk> , the <unk> karel <unk> responded similarly .
for instance regarding the term " golf hole . "
" it 's the only one of the presented words that i use at least occasionally . "
" otherwise , i generally do not <unk> the <unk> . "
out of the <unk> , published by <unk> last june just before the election congress of <unk> , <unk> selected six examples , mainly well - known in connection with the prague city hall .
the socialists were to explain the concepts of " <unk> , " the " greatest golf hole in prague , " " go to a <unk> bar , " " <unk> neck , " " <unk> of the capital " and " to plate with metal . "
three <unk> agreed with the <unk> , the fourth - <unk> <unk> , who is to head the education in prague in the future - promised to attend an interview first , but later he stopped answering the phone .
the fifth <unk> , peter <unk> , refused the test straight away .
" i do not pay attention to such things at all and i am not going to evaluate the way the civic democrats talk . "
" i am rather concerned how we will match our <unk> , " he said .
as we already mentioned , <unk> <unk> <unk> would reportedly not <unk> in the above heading that it is about an influential <unk> and friend of ex - mayor <unk> , roman <unk> .
" <unk> " bears no meaning to <unk> and the only term he correctly <unk> in the test is " the greatest golf hole in prague . "
" it 's <unk> tunnel , " says <unk> , and immediately adds : " but i know it from the newspapers . "
" i 'll have to get myself a language course , " he <unk> .
golf hole as the <unk> tunnel was then correctly <unk> by not only the <unk> karel <unk> , but also the <unk> for the environment , <unk> <unk> .
both social democrats then also know who is actually <unk> and <unk> <unk> is familiar with this character - he also <unk> the right meaning of the phrase " to go to a <unk> bar . "
" that means going to a company in prague " he sails close to the meaning , which is the office of <unk> 's companies .
similarly to <unk> he notes that he gained the knowledge from the newspapers rather than using such a vocabulary himself .
according to the <unk> , there is no such <unk> <unk> of <unk> terms in social democrats party .
" i even consulted my colleagues , but it seems that we really do not have anything like that . "
" we rather address one another with names , sometimes we use abbreviations and name <unk> , " said prague <unk> chairman peter <unk> , addressed by party members as <unk> .
" at school i was called <unk> , but i do not know if my colleagues call me so , " he admits his own <unk> , karel <unk> .
<unk> tested the <unk> and it works .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> or less friendly old man for party members , the <unk> miroslav <unk> , who won attention just before the election by the fraud in party sponsorship , was <unk> " <unk> " by some colleagues .
<unk> are also the only thing accepted by the social democrats in the intra - party speech .
<unk> reportedly does not like to be addressed as <unk> , but <unk> has also seen another <unk> of that prague chairman .
" <unk> of black - <unk> law " supposedly recalls that peter <unk> got his degree of <unk> at the police academy in bratislava .
the government wants to limit the torture of " <unk> , " a <unk> was released
women declared as <unk> in <unk> <unk> usually have several common characteristics .
they rather come from the older generation , cannot engage in work for health reasons for instance , are <unk> and have no children .
the one who " becomes " a witch is sent into isolation in order to not <unk> the rest of the village .
" such a fate <unk> men only very rarely . "
" nor healthy young women are sent away because they help with work and bear children , " says the <unk> , who takes care for more than a hundred women banished from their community in a special care home in the capital of <unk> <unk> , west africa .
local government now decided to combat the unusual " social measures . "
it has published an information <unk> , which should help limit the witch - hunt .
but there is a <unk> in that .
" more than 00 percent of adults in <unk> <unk> cannot read , " pointed out the disadvantage of written education die standard daily .
accusations of <unk> are also common in other african countries .
in <unk> , which borders with <unk> <unk> , a seventy - two <unk> <unk> died last week after three women and two men tortured her , <unk> in kerosene and set <unk> .
the case was reported by <unk> .
the perpetrators claim that it was an unfortunate coincidence .
according to their version the oil that is used for ritual <unk> <unk> and burned the woman to death .
it allegedly burst into flames after the group wanted to " expel the evil spirit " from the woman .
isolation of " <unk> " is widely supported by people regardless of their education level .
daily der standard quoted a <unk> of forty - two from <unk> <unk> : " <unk> of human souls have always posed a danger , " he said .
while in <unk> <unk> the government is trying hard to moderate the witch hunt , the <unk> 's president himself participated in the hunt last year .
" <unk> president <unk> after the death of his <unk> unleashed a large - scale witch - hunt for <unk> allegedly involved in her death and trying to use black magic to kill the president . "
" he invited <unk> from nearby guinea to help him and they accompanied by policemen , soldiers and president 's private security guards forced <unk> selected men and women from <unk> villages to the president 's ranch in <unk> , " said amnesty international in their report .
the arrested people had to drink a <unk> of <unk> with <unk> effects , which also causes <unk> and <unk> problems .
two prisoners did not survive .
after international pressure nearly a thousand of inmates were released .
<unk> 's <unk> : heating in the <unk> , signed the rent increase
an older <unk> man <unk> out of the door of the client <unk> of <unk> flats company owned by the ' coal <unk> ' <unk> <unk> , the largest privately owned rental <unk> " <unk> in the czech republic .
under his arm he carried a <unk> with new lease contracts to three flats : his , his daughter 's and his son 's , who is in prison .
all the three 's rent has just risen due to deregulation .
from next year will the son pay <unk> 0000 for the second class 0 + 0 apartment instead of the current <unk> 0000 per month .
" and there is no hot water and we must heat in the " <unk> <unk> " ( solid fuel <unk> , ed . note ) " the man points his finger on his son 's new contract , which he is <unk> to signed by <unk> .
" but i signed it , " he says half <unk> , half <unk> .
<unk> civic association , which identified the new <unk> conditions as " unfair and immoral , " <unk> <unk> not to sign the new contract and wait until 0 december , when they will publish a guidance on how to counter them .
but the man remains <unk> .
" one says this , another that , " he <unk> .
<unk> has become a great laboratory of deregulation .
after the new year the vast majority of dwellings with non - market rent in the czech republic will be subject to deregulation .
<unk> therefore decided to visit the " laboratory " itself .
<unk> 's waiting room of <unk> is one of the four in the <unk> region and is already full at nine a.m. on <unk> .
standing right at the door , there is a security guard from a security agency with a call device nearby .
special button " rent 0000 " <unk> on the touch screen .
one tap and the machine issues a slip with a number .
you do not even manage to read " 000 " and your figure <unk> on the large screen below the ceiling of the waiting room .
it is your turn in half a second .
an older couple comes to ask about the lease after a few moments , there is apparently no rush for new <unk> in the waiting room at all .
most people came to solve the same problems as usual - request for <unk> , <unk> events etc.
letters with new <unk> have been sent to <unk> of most of the <unk> of 00 thousand dwellings <unk> portfolio in the <unk> region since about mid - november .
<unk> <unk> proposes to increase rent by 00 to 00 percent in these letters .
a special desk for new <unk> was opened on 00 november in the client <unk> .
" it has been in operation for over a week , so it 's only run - in , " respond the <unk> at the desk after some hesitation , when the client introduces himself as a journalist .
deregulation and <unk> 's former mining flats are local hot topic .
before the elections , it was quite <unk> adopted by parliament vice - president and a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of the social democrats , and even now it fills local newspapers .
" i have been asking them for this new floor for twenty years . "
" they have not even changed a <unk> . king plate in the <unk> , " relieves the man mentioned in the introduction .
it is mostly the retired who only come to see if they can i get a <unk> on rent if they sign on time , as <unk> their promises in their special offer .
half off the february rent will also receive the other <unk> who will have signed the new contract by 00 december .
<unk> 's " deregulatory " desk is certainly not overwhelmed with questions .
" out of yesterday 's 000 clients only about forty to fifty came to inquire about <unk> in 0000 , " estimates the <unk> behind the counter .
<unk> on their bulletin boards and web site proposed the negotiation of individual contracts where needed .
however , if the parties fail to agree on the lease , an independent tribunal will have to establish the rent .
" this is not a threat , but the information on the only possible legitimate and completely legal procedure , " says <unk> on its website .
" nobody will <unk> them here , " said one of the <unk> flats <unk> and the man on the street outside the client <unk> partly agrees .
" i have <unk> 00,000 pension and five thousands are left for the <unk> , i cannot afford bringing it to the court , " he said .
the <unk> but then doubts after all .
" we 'll see . "
" mr. <unk> <unk> them in the media not to sign , so some people are waiting , " she thinks .
the regulation of <unk> ends in the most of the czech republic with the new year 0000 and according to <unk> <unk> is the increase of <unk> an economic necessity .
" the current rent is still less than the amount needed for simple maintenance of housing stock , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , director of <unk> portfolio of residential <unk> , and reminded that neglect of the housing stock complained about in relation just to those angry <unk> , is the main reason for the increase in <unk> according to the house owners .
while within the five years between 0000 and 0000 could <unk> invest four billion from the <unk> into the <unk> , within the four years between 0000 and 0000 it should be 0.0 billion .
large screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the <unk> seats of <unk> 's waiting room keeps repeating some information highlighted in red .
" the increase in <unk> in 0000 by 00 % and less concerns 00,000 flats , it is more than 00 % of <unk> <unk> . "
" and it will always be a maximum of <unk> 0.00 per square <unk> and month , " appears on the screen .
only for 000 <unk> of <unk> portfolio the rent will rise by 00 percent .
" in these cases there will be an increase from an extremely low amount of <unk> 00.00 per square <unk> , " points <unk> .
in 0000 <unk> will the rent remain the same next year .
<unk> <unk> promises that deregulation of <unk> will not be sudden , it will be spread over four to eight years .
it adds another commitment : all the money from rent increases ( see the <unk> ) will be invested by the company back to the flats , especially in heat savings - new <unk> and insulation .
priority will be given to people who sign the agreement to increase <unk> .
offices need a <unk> nearby , architects have understood
<unk> office building in <unk> is the new headquarters of <unk> . design company .
nobody would expect that it contains a tiny <unk> with everything necessary - with <unk> walls , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of toys and even a <unk> golf course on the <unk> <unk> .
since october last year the children of <unk> . design employees can attend .
architectural design company , <unk> . design , whose <unk> produced a number of important buildings in <unk> , have included the space for their corporate tiny <unk> even in the first <unk> of the <unk> building .
it indeed employs nearly 00 people - mainly baby - boom - aged and they want their female <unk> and architects to quickly return to work .
along with the possibility of part - time contracts the <unk> is a benefit that <unk> . design offers to their employees within their welfare program .
female construction engineers and architects have thus the opportunity to combine their demanding jobs with child care .
<unk> <unk> has been invented by <unk> . design employees themselves and with the support from management they were able to obtain a grant of the european union and the ministry of labour and social affairs .
corporate tiny <unk> is funded by the european social fund through the operational program human resources and employment and state budget of <unk> .
thanks to grant funding ( subsidy of 0.0 million ) they were able to purchase equipment and for the period of two years provide qualified personnel and operation .
after the depletion of financial aid ( 0 years ) the <unk> . design company must operate the <unk> for 0 years at its own expense .
preparation of the project lasted one year and the economy rating company helped with the applications for grant significantly .
the care is provided by qualified staff , children are taken care of by a <unk> and a <unk> teacher all day ; the <unk> can therefore be attended by children without any age restrictions , but most of them are over 0 years old .
as this is a " mini - <unk> , " only 0 children may be present at the same time , even though more can attend in the course of the day altogether .
the operation of the <unk> is flexible to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the <unk> , regardless of the position in the company hierarchy .
although this is an individual education and care , the program content in the mini - <unk> is comparable with the framework program of <unk> education .
children are not only playing here , they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation for schooling and english is also taught here .
the class is not only equipped with toys , inspiring games , but also with a computer that children can use .
the presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment .
parents can always check their child and it prevents stress situations related to delayed pick - up from nurseries located far from their parents " workplace .
parents then use the working time much more efficiently .
not surprisingly , a loyal employee - employer relationship is produced there naturally .
<unk> . design became one of the czech companies , which offer significant benefit when recruiting new employees , they are friendly to the family and through this program they have enhanced personnel marketing .
house of bones <unk> even after 000 years . look at the <unk> by <unk>
the <unk> looks like a <unk> <unk> 's spine , the <unk> reminds of a dinosaur backbone and <unk> are open fish mouths .
this is the house of <unk> <unk> in barcelona by the catalan architect <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> started to call it the house of bones for its organic shapes .
organic shapes , wild <unk> , unusual use of stone , fragments of <unk> and mosaics , <unk> reminiscent of <unk> and soft <unk> everywhere , all of which are typical of art <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of the house opens <unk> lines , soft <unk> and <unk> reminiscent of nature and animals .
the detailed look reveals <unk> , rhythm , and well - considered order .
at night , the entire <unk> of the house seems even more <unk> , it is <unk> so that the <unk> paint impression would be further enhanced .
<unk> and <unk> shapes appear equally as much indoors .
wood follows in the window <unk> in the waves , along with <unk> , door <unk> , <unk> and watch .
<unk> house , located in the <unk> <unk> on a busy shopping street <unk> de <unk> no. 00 , was rebuilt from the original house in 0000 by the architect <unk> <unk> <unk> .
reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 0000 .
the investor , a wealthy <unk> josep <unk> , initially insisted on the <unk> of the old building and construction of an entirely new one , but soon he adopted <unk> 's idea of an unusual and cheaper <unk> of the house .
apartment building <unk> <unk> was nevertheless not designed by <unk> <unk> alone .
architect josep maria <unk> cooperated with him .
it was his <unk> 's board where the <unk> for the representative apartment of the property <unk> were created , as well as the use of a mosaic on the <unk> .
a number of other authors and artists worked on the <unk> .
joint work on <unk> for <unk> <unk> building started a successful cooperation of <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> took part in the construction of <unk> 's building <unk> <unk> and park <unk> , which contains other <unk> 's works .
the <unk> started to call it the " house of bones " for its organic shapes soon after its completion .
others began to call it a " <unk> house " for its specific mechanism of <unk> opening .
it is also said that on top of the building there is a representation of the sword of <unk> george , the <unk> of <unk> .
other <unk> elements of the building also contain hidden religious motives .
<unk> designed a central heating system in the house , unique for his time , with ventilation and typical <unk> .
their forty - five degree <unk> may seem bizarre .
when creating <unk> totally disregarded building regulations of the time and did not let them tied him up .
at the start of construction he actually received a building permit from the city , but the provided details about the planned reconstruction were so vague , that two years after the completion the city council was horrified by the result and asked for redress .
<unk> did mind for example that the building <unk> with its pillars into the public <unk> .
the correction never happened , rather the opposite : only fifteen days after the request from the city , josep <unk> applied for ( and successfully received ) the permission to lease the top two floors of the building .
the <unk> himself moved to lower floors .
there was a <unk> hall in the gallery on the second floor and on the third floor there was a <unk> and a private section of the apartment .
the ground floor was leased to a <unk> .
the entire six - <unk> building is <unk> by a <unk> , which ends only at the <unk> <unk> .
the key elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and replacing them with <unk> walls .
<unk> also worked with the modern concept of space interconnection .
the social part is completely connected by opening the <unk> door and a larger group can comfortably communicate without losing the necessary privacy for intimate conversations .
the house won due to <unk> 's rebuilding a new <unk> and also the unusual <unk> and two extra floors .
<unk> 's play with light is also impressive , along with blue and white <unk> <unk> used to line the inner courtyard and <unk> .
the play of two <unk> delivers a maximum of light on all floors of the house .
it was enough to gamble on the principle that white reflects light more than dark <unk> , which absorb the sun 's <unk> on the contrary .
<unk> <unk> house , which was included in unesco world heritage fund in 0000 , can be visited by anyone .
the most <unk> and most <unk> apartment has been opened to the public on the first floor .
the owners decided to move this up in 0000 to celebrate the one hundred <unk> anniversary of the birth of the famous author .
they kept providing the <unk> since they discovered that this is a very profitable business , plus they extended <unk> by the common and <unk> spaces , including a <unk> <unk> .
admission to the sight is certainly not negligible , amounts to 00.00 euros , while students , <unk> , groups and travel passes holders receive a twenty percent <unk> .
the amount greatly exceeds the price of admission to other <unk> 's buildings in the city .
if you want to experience the true atmosphere of the house with <unk> <unk> , you have to quickly make friends with any of the inhabitants of the apartment house and visit them at home .
how to choose the <unk> and the <unk> bed base : women have different requirements from men
not <unk> bed frame , but the quality of the lying area , that is the <unk> and <unk> bed base gives a really good bed .
they must however match in a harmonious way to suit a specific user .
the selection decisions are influenced by lots of things such as the weight , height , age , health , and gender of the <unk> .
also the type of interior , into which the <unk> and <unk> base are purchased , is important .
a typical example ?
for instance for summer houses which are not heated regularly , <unk> <unk> are not suitable because they warm up rather slowly .
in addition , they tend to have significantly higher weight than a standard <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it is also necessary to turn them regularly .
if they do not have enough <unk> channels in their core , and still lie on a hard board , they retain <unk> : even <unk> could occur beneath the <unk> .
the choice is also influenced by habits .
who spent more time abroad , where they often use very <unk> <unk> with <unk> layer , they will find it hard to feel good on a thin one with hard surface .
" perhaps all hockey players returning from the <unk> complained to me that they were <unk> . "
" their battered shoulders , heels and <unk> needed the <unk> to be softened with a layer of <unk> <unk> . "
" those are recommended even for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder , so they assume ' information ' from the <unk> and skin in an ill way , " explains <unk> <unk> , who <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
she therefore looked for <unk> <unk> <unk> for many hockey players , but also other customers years ago .
" now it 's okay , suitable <unk> can be found at <unk> , italian <unk> , but also czech <unk> . "
you need not be an <unk> guy to appreciate the <unk> <unk> .
this " miracle " works in a simple manner .
<unk> its rigidity and shape by the heat absorbed or <unk> to your body warm .
you feel no press and will not keep changing position on your bed all night as if you were after a tough game .
you will just <unk> better .
<unk> <unk> also works well as a protection against pressure <unk> .
when choosing the size of your <unk> thickness , add one foot length to your height , which is about 00-00 <unk> .
man and woman with a height of about 000 <unk> then need a bed of 000-000 <unk> .
the minimum width for one should be <unk> in double bed , i.e. 000 <unk> altogether .
in separate beds , for example for <unk> , it is recommended at least 000 to 000 <unk> .
for both usual comfort and a possible <unk> .
" otherwise the rule for bed width is simple : when lying on your back , you should keep your hands comfortably slightly bent at the elbow , " <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> , head of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , who has addressed the issue of healthy <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> for many years and teaches it to colleges .
for everyone needs their own <unk> and a <unk> base in a double bed , be careful to buy match the thickness of <unk> when buying them .
otherwise you will have to fit into <unk> bases into different heights , which may not be possible with every frame of the bed .
<unk> <unk> should be at least 00 <unk> , while the frame types with a spring framework should be at least 00 <unk> , including at least three <unk> count for the shaping and <unk> layer .
" you must not feel the springs when touching the <unk> with hands or sitting down on the <unk> , " warns <unk> <unk> .
each <unk> requires a certain type of <unk> base .
<unk> beds , where the <unk> and the foundation are like <unk> <unk> <unk> , should not appear in <unk> .
it is hard to air the <unk> ; you can not wash the fabric either , which should be a must today .
and since we normally <unk> 0.0 to 0.00 <unk> of <unk> during the night , it is obvious that after five to seven years the <unk> will resemble a large ( and <unk> ) <unk> .
that 's why experts refuse advertising slogans of life of the <unk> up to 00 years , or even a lifetime <unk> .
everything has its pros and cons .
therefore , the practical advice from <unk> is as follows : do not give up hygiene for <unk> with a width of 000 and 000 <unk> and their <unk> and <unk> cover , rather add a <unk> <unk> , which can be easily removed and washed .
although today <unk> covers are now commonly manufactured with a <unk> around the <unk> , so after opening you get two parts ( vital for washing and the size of washing machine ! ) , handling the larger types when removing them ( and in one person ) may remind of a match of light - weight <unk> a heavy one in the ring .
do you have a fixed plate in the bed instead of a <unk> base ?
never !
if so , then only in a bed for one - night visitors .
the board should nevertheless be equipped ( if not already ) with ventilation <unk> and use the <unk> with spring framework of a minimum height of 00 <unk> with springs in the bags ( from german <unk> ) and a <unk> layer .
<unk> <unk> should not be on such a basis .
for non - positioning <unk> with 00-00 <unk> , <unk> or <unk> <unk> will be suitable ( maybe a combination of <unk> and <unk> ) , but it always pays back to get the <unk> bases with larger number of <unk> , 00 or more , where there are double <unk> in the <unk> area and their <unk> can be regulated .
<unk> with spring <unk> should not lie on <unk> <unk> as they do not respond to positioning .
in addition to adjusting the <unk> of <unk> you can also enjoy the so - called shoulder cradle .
this is a special mounting of <unk> , which enables to push , or even tilt the plate so that the arm of the <unk> would nicely " fit into the <unk> . "
for men whose shoulders are " all over their back , " this is certainly an important thing .
even <unk> manufacturers respect it when in " men " <unk> they began to use the <unk> zone right in the shoulder area .
they also remember the women - those indulge in the softer surface of the <unk> area .
<unk> or <unk> <unk> with the so - called multi - <unk> suspension are intended for the most demanding customers .
the pressure is spread into several points and the tension reduces .
but be careful when you use a wrong <unk> with a correct <unk> and <unk> base ( large and " <unk> " ) , most of the " <unk> " will disappear .
the basic rule is simple : the <unk> should support the head and touch the shoulders with its <unk> so that the shoulder <unk> could relax .
a suitable size of 00 x 00 <unk> recommended , preferred for example in scandinavia .
when lying on the side , the <unk> should be able to deal ( along with the shoulder cradle of the <unk> bed or softened zone in the <unk> ) with shoulder height .
modern <unk> do have something in common with original <unk> filled with <unk> .
their manufacturers increasingly use natural materials , or at least <unk> .
there is simply an organic trend even in <unk> .
raw materials from oil , out of which <unk> <unk> is made , are being replaced with natural <unk> , such as from <unk> and <unk> - oil plant .
it is just <unk> that all well - known manufacturers use now .
" organic in <unk> means that the core is made of purely natural material , " explains <unk> <unk> from the company <unk> plus .
natural products are also used in the production of <unk> covers , one of the first was <unk> <unk> .
but you can also indulge in <unk> that can release fresh <unk> of <unk> or forest .
there is even a division for men and women .
while men are " <unk> " by <unk> <unk> of <unk> , so that the <unk> cover would absorb heat and <unk> the body , women are on the contrary " <unk> " by the covers .
the <unk> of red <unk> increases circulation of blood , so the weaker sex feels warmer .
today 's <unk> ?
<unk> made of cold <unk> ( with larger <unk> with a damaged <unk> structure is more <unk> than regular <unk> and has a better elasticity .
combining different <unk> of cold <unk> and " <unk> " <unk> result in multi - zone <unk> that know exactly where the head should be , as well as shoulders and heels .
you will pay seven thousand crowns and above for a good quality <unk> .
those that meet health parameters tend to have lower rate of vat as they are considered medical equipment .
<unk> was the first to employ this advantage in the czech republic .
it is not easy to save on the <unk> and the <unk> base .
sometimes you can use special offers of manufacturers or retailers , who offer two <unk> for the price of one .
for instance <unk> brand offers their <unk> <unk> with the memory <unk> memory <unk> into the cover for 00 000 crowns .
however , you can get the second one for free .
the era of <unk> or <unk> <unk> with open <unk> structure and high density was started by <unk> material in a " <unk> " pace .
it was originally developed as a material for nasa because the <unk> were exposed to enormous <unk> during the start .
<unk> <unk> when warm , but strengthens in the cold .
it is then perfectly adapted to warm human body and <unk> its pressure optimally .
it is therefore ideal to prevent pressure <unk> development , but also to enhance comfort while <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are used not only for <unk> , but also medical products , such as special <unk> under the feet , which mitigate the legs and <unk> system .
domestic producers use the <unk> <unk> or <unk> c and such .
devices for people monitoring are required by more and more parents , who want to watch their children
fear for their own child brings more people to the idea of watching them using gps .
the system originally created to search for cars could also monitor the movement of people and thus should help in cases such as the disappearance of nine - year - old <unk> <unk> .
the facility is currently of the size of a matchbox , but it may soon be as big as a watch .
many people have been <unk> by the case of missing <unk> and thus began to search for ways to protect their children better .
even at the cost of disruption to their privacy .
" we say to all that it is not <unk> , but a means to further reduce the probability that a tragedy happens , " said <unk> <unk> of the macro <unk> , one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment on the czech market .
" i admit that under certain circumstances it may lead to misuse of such equipment , if they are put in a bag of someone who does not know it , but we have not seen such cases yet . "
" most customers actually buy it for security reasons , " he added .
according to him , the child should always know for what the purpose of the " box " is and how it is used in an emergency .
child psychologist <unk> <unk> points out that if a child does not want to wear something like that , it will just get rid of it .
" even very young children show great creativity how to lose some things on purpose if they do not want to be under control . "
" great parents ' expectations were fueled by <unk> <unk> before , but those can be switched off as well as this tracking device , " says <unk> .
according to her it is questionable whether , in the event of an attack such a device would really help .
" as for the upcoming kidnapping , the <unk> almost always ensures that the child should not carry any <unk> that might reveal his position . "
" it 's the phone now . "
" when tracking devices get more common , they will look for those , because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising . "
" in this case , the criminals are always one step ahead of police , " says the psychologist .
she admits , however , that similar devices may help in case of sudden attack by a <unk> .
according to robert <unk> of rc monitoring company that provides tracking services for both cars and for people , even when there is an attack and immediate destruction of the tracking device , its presence can help .
" the device can be set to send regular position report after a certain period of time . "
" if it becomes damaged , we will have at least the last position of the person . "
" the more expensive devices have in - built and <unk> , so even if one just <unk> and remains lying <unk> , the device immediately sends a warning with location , " says czech .
according to him a similar service may be provided by smart mobile <unk> with navigation , where it is enough to load a special software .
the problem of current surveillance units lies in the fact that it is either a device similar to <unk> of matchbox size or smaller mobile <unk> .
there is always the risk of their loss .
according to <unk> from the macro <unk> company a device that looks like a conventional digital watch is now being tested .
" this will be the biggest advantage that the <unk> may not even <unk> the tracking device at all . "
" or they <unk> it after some time and it may give the police extra time , " he adds .
whether you the tracking devices develop into <unk> or <unk> , they are still using the same technology as that used for monitoring vehicles .
it is a combination of location detection via gps ( used by regular car navigation ) and the functions of a mobile phone , which reports the current vehicle position .
the army has enough <unk> cord to wind the whole of czech republic . but they will expire in only two years .
czech army has purchased 000 <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> explosives .
already last year the ministry of defence delivered 000 km of the <unk> lines into the warehouses .
the army thus has reserves for 000 years .
the problem is that life of the lines is two to four years .
the army purchased the <unk> <unk> from <unk> group , <unk> for <unk> 00 million .
the general staff provided the reasoning for buying such a huge quantity of <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> stating that soldiers use 00 km of <unk> <unk> in training per year .
calculations of army bomb disposal experts that the <unk> <unk> approached imply that it would be a very intense pyrotechnic training that would be <unk> also by all the generals every year , along with the officers of the army , secretaries and <unk> .
<unk> minister <unk> <unk> and army commander <unk> pick included .
only thus could be the army annual consumption of sixty <unk> of <unk> <unk> justified .
this period corresponds to 00,000 <unk> .
and even if it were true , the army reserves would be enough for more than ten years .
however , if the basic training of any new professional actually needed just two <unk> of the <unk> cord , as the experts say , then the army has ensured by the purchase - even with increased consumption by engineer or special units - the stock for the above 000 years .
rapid deployment <unk> soldiers personally complained recently to the minister <unk> that they have almost no ammunition for small arms and so <unk> are limited due to shortage of money .
not mentioning the lack of <unk> .
" i do not understand either , that they buy so many <unk> <unk> from us repeatedly . "
" but it 's their decision , and they certainly know what they will use them for . "
" for us , the army is a good customer , whose demands we try to meet as retailers , " says the sales manager of <unk> group , jan <unk> .
<unk> ministry spokesman jan <unk> reasons for the purchased hundreds of <unk> of <unk> by creation reserves of such " munitions " for ten years at least .
jan <unk> of <unk> group , however , speaks only of the four - year life of the <unk> and police or army <unk> even of mere two years .
" if stored under perfect conditions , it can be even four , " said one , who as a soldier does not want to disclose the name when <unk> the military .
after expiry date any ammunition must be carefully tested for reliability to make sure it does not endanger the life of soldiers .
these tests are not free and it cost more money .
another argument of the ministry is the quantity <unk> on 000 km of the <unk> <unk> .
" it cost us about sixty percent less than last year 's supply of two hundred forty - four <unk> , " says the speaker <unk> the opinion of buyers of the ministry of defence .
just for comparison : annual consumption of firing lines of police <unk> who destroy munitions from world war ii and the one left after the soviet army has not exceeded 0000 <unk> for several years .
a police orders only such amount of the ammunition that would be used before its <unk> .
it paid back for the safety of <unk> and the flexibility to acquire more modern and thus more reliable types of lines .
ministry of defence has already considerable problems with the liquidation of tens of thousand tons of ammunition from the times of the warsaw pact , when the two - hundred - thousand czechoslovak army was preparing to set off for the <unk> .
the czech one , according to the <unk> approached by <unk> <unk> , will face the same problem in a few years : they will dispose of hundreds of <unk> of old <unk> <unk> that are currently " cheaply " purchased .
to this day i use the contacts i gained through the competition
winning the prize in the <unk> of the year helped <unk> <unk> sell the <unk> of his hotel .
the winner of last year 's <unk> of the year was a twenty - eight - year - old <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
his success story is much like one from a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> liked to travel .
and abroad he <unk> that <unk> lacks quality accommodation at a reasonable price .
using his savings from foreign part - time jobs and a bank loan he purchased a ruined house with five <unk> .
it was a great courage considering that at that time he was still a student of the third year at university .
" the ratio between quality and price of accommodation of the time in our country made me i try to do something , " says <unk> <unk> .
the first renovated apartment he rented to foreign workers .
all profits were invested back into the house , which he gradually <unk> into a boarding house with 00 beds .
since then , he has managed to gradually open four guest houses in <unk> within the seven years of his business , along with two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of 000 beds across all categories of accommodation .
until recently , the most comfortable one was <unk> four - star design hotel .
this year another one was open , equally good .
" we have signed a contract with a hotel in <unk> u <unk> , where we sold our <unk> concept and others interested in the <unk> hotel <unk> are applying , " says last year 's number one trader .
" and the sale of the license to operate the hotel was very much influenced just by winning the competition <unk> of the year , " <unk> adds <unk> .
the victory brought more reputation and popularity in <unk> and its surroundings .
" people recognized me in the streets , often <unk> congratulated me and i must say it felt good , " he recalls .
he strongly encourages all who are eager to try something to participate in the competition .
it is not necessary to win , any visibility is good .
he says he still draws on contacts and <unk> , which would perhaps not get otherwise .
" with some i <unk> met through the competition , i started a regular business . "
in his opinion , the glory associated with the success landed a bit on each employee .
and there are about seventy of them .
" i see them show greater loyalty and pride that they are involved in something that gained universal recognition . "
" it 's much more than just my personal success , as it is the result of good work of all of us together . "
" only my name is thrust into the forefront , " says <unk> <unk> <unk> today .
i wish my successor quieter year than we had in <unk>
euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis .
with self - discipline of the winner <unk> has already overcome bad times .
prize for the first place in last year 's <unk> competition company of the year was in the <unk> house collected by the <unk> of <unk> company , karel <unk> .
the jury then appreciated the efforts by which a small tool workshop in <unk> <unk> grew into a business with hundred - million <unk> .
" i can say that the award encouraged not only me but all my colleagues and increased our confidence for battles with the competition , " says the last - year winner today .
in the early history of the <unk> company there was a desire to do something useful .
and so , when the state offered the father of charles <unk> to rent a small workshop to compensate for the <unk> - confiscated property , he did not hesitate any long , rejected a career in the company , where he was working , and with a few friends around his father he founded the company producing plastic <unk> .
soon after that they began to <unk> in vegetable oil presses .
after eighteen years , they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central europe .
greater awareness among the general public was won after the success in the competition through the media .
" not only our customers have begun to perceive the brand <unk> much better , but also foreign partners have begun to appreciate that they work with a company that has achieved greater success in its home country , " says karel <unk> .
last year , however , was not only full of the euphoria of <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> were based on firm economic performance until 0000 and only partly from 0000 .
and just 0000 was the <unk> year for the sale of engineering goods .
crisis was at its very peak , not touching so many people yet , but companies had stopped their investment projects and began to restrict purchases of new machinery and technology .
" the situation obviously did not spare us . "
" sales fell by 00 percent , we had to restrict production and even discharge employees , " explains karel <unk> .
a viable company must be able to take even such <unk> measures sometimes .
however , they managed and retained the profit , even though lower than before the crisis .
however , what <unk> would not compromise , is the investment in research and development .
" with the help of subsidies we have built a research and training <unk> , we have enhanced our presentation at international <unk> , won major <unk> in local <unk> , " says <unk> .
the crisis seems to be behind them .
revenues are growing again and so is the number of new employees .
" i wish the nice feeling of victory to the new winner , but in a more peaceful atmosphere , " says karel <unk> .
survey that removes absurd regulations
poll of the <unk> is a part of the business competition for the fourth time .
some ridiculous regulations have are already been removed .
infamous winner of next year 's poll of <unk> was the absurd obligation to bring documents that are accessible for officials online to the authorities .
it was chosen by more than a third of almost four thousand votes .
for example , social security administration required a paper certificate of incorporation , although the officer can obtain one by two <unk> of a <unk> .
thanks to the poll , this will change .
" the czech social security administration will not require the certificate of incorporation from for controls of <unk> , " said spokesman <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
to crack down on all the rules and regulations that companies and businesses in the czech republic must meet , and remove those that lack sense , is the essence of the poll of <unk> .
this is the fourth time this year , it has been a part of the business competition , held by <unk> <unk> and it is becoming increasingly popular among the public .
if about three thousand voters were involved in the vote last year , there were nearly four thousand voters earlier this year .
and not surprisingly , there are still many legal obligations , which only serve to delay the business .
" for instance in the number of papers required for tax returns we keep the top places in the world , " said karel <unk> of the association of small and medium - sized enterprises and <unk> in <unk> .
simplification of business has in recent years become a stated objective of all governments .
but compared with the rest of the world the situation has not really improved in the czech republic .
according to the world bank , in terms of business conditions the czech republic was ranked 00th position ; it is eight points less than last year .
the poll of <unk> was first launched in 0000 and takes place every year under the same scenario .
anyone may propose administrative and bureaucratic <unk> every year from april to september , when is there is the deadline for the competition .
in order to sign for the competition , website <unk> " <unk> " is to be used . <unk> then chooses the seven candidates for the " anti - award " and allows the public vote for it in october at the website <unk> / <unk> and <unk> .
the absurdity that gets most votes wins .
in this survey more than a hundred , 000 to be precise , meaningless rules and regulations were filed .
<unk> were received from entrepreneurs , but also professional associations and journalists .
among the " <unk> " of the <unk> was for instance the requirement that the trucks for maintenance of <unk> were to pay road - tolls , or that businesses with twenty employees , two offices and two <unk> had those painted every two years .
the list of this year 's seven proposals is posted on the website of the <unk> .
announcement of the competition , which always takes place in early november on <unk> square in prague is part of the <unk> , regularly attended by personalities of the political and social life .
this year , for example , the <unk> of the competition was assisted by <unk> <unk> , director of the association of small and medium - sized enterprises and <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> , president of the chamber of commerce in <unk> .
" economic prosperity can not work where the state is throwing business in its own foot , so my goal is to annually remove at least three dozen paragraphs , which today only unnecessarily complicate the business , " said minister of industry and trade martin <unk> .
efforts to abolish meaningless regulations has rather positive load .
in 0000 most people were against the obligation of a business to report their intention to take part at the exhibition or fair with their stand three days ahead to the trade office at the place where its permanent establishment is located .
this has been removed by an amendment to the trade act .
the second most voted obligation in 0000 , which was reporting a business trip of foreign staff lasting up to 00 days to the labour office , was removed by the so - called green card act .
and last but not least .
absurdity of 0000 was the obligation of <unk> to have a large mirror , a <unk> and two stepping <unk> in the office .
it was <unk> by the ministry of health this year - the obligation to have a <unk> has been removed .
new category <unk> socially responsible companies
environmental , humanitarian , educational and sports projects are considered .
new in the fifth year of <unk> daily competition is the category called the responsible company in 0000 .
the mission of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business .
" we want this to support companies that reflect their business " impact on the environment and encourage socially responsible activities , " says <unk> <unk> , regional manager of <unk> mobile operator company , which is the promoter and guarantor of the competition , as well as in the case of the rebel competition .
in the first year of this special <unk> of the main <unk> competition company of the year 0000 , companies , for whom success in business is not the only long - term goal , signed for the competition .
each story is very inspirational and would be enough for a separate article .
although the nature of their activities varies considerably , the common denominator of their efforts may be the support and <unk> .
in one case , for example , it relates to people with disabilities and elsewhere to personal problems or health of their employees .
among the <unk> <unk> in <unk> we find a prague - located software company et <unk> who supports the creation of informal sports teams of staff which then participate in a number of <unk> in different sports .
another example of a responsible company from the <unk> region is the company <unk> - <unk> , who has been a major contributor to the <unk> fund for <unk> children for <unk> years .
old mill of <unk> then takes care of their disabled employees , who are more than 00 percent of the whole staff , and was thus awarded with the title of responsible company in the central bohemia region and won the third place in the <unk> competition company of the year .
in the <unk> region the award was received by <unk> soft accounting firm , which has introduced flexible working hours in addition to the reduced average 00 hours per week but did not reduce salary proportionately .
the title was also awarded to the company because they preferably buy from czech manufacturers , promote civic activities in the <unk> and protect the environment .
" we try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration had the least impact on the environment , " explains the executive <unk> <unk> .
responsible it company <unk> in the <unk> region then thinks about the health of its employees , and for each <unk> purchased they bought <unk> chairs and <unk> , support their work from home and use catering services provided by a local sheltered workshop for their corporate events .
" in addition , we support the people in need foundation , which helps the local roma community in particular , " says company representative <unk> <unk> .
finally , worth noting is also the activity of <unk> a <unk> company of the <unk> vary region , which contributes its employees with bonuses to their pension schemes .
" we provide <unk> for <unk> , transport , <unk> and recreation , " says <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> construction company , the winner in the <unk> - silesian region .
for the responsible company of the year category were automatically <unk> all regional <unk> of <unk> company of the year competition , who answered the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to <unk> until 00 august .
incorrectly filled or incomplete answers to the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the <unk> .
" if the representatives of competing companies failed to answer the questions , they could not attend the responsible company of the year competition , but are not <unk> from the " main " <unk> competition company of the year . "
" single sign just for this competition is not possible because it is a <unk> of the main competition company of the year , " explains karel goldman of the <unk> agency <unk> & rose .
police made arrests at the land fund in <unk> during the <unk> procedure
in recent days the anti - corruption police made arrests at the building of the land fund in <unk> .
<unk> were put by <unk> to a local <unk> in the media sector and real estate <unk> , <unk> g.
he allegedly attempted to manipulate the current tender for the settlement of <unk> claims , so that the land offered was awarded to a particular candidate .
he was supposed to pay half a million to <unk> g.
so far i can only confirm that the police prosecute one person for the <unk> of fraudulent manipulation of public procurement and public tenders , " said the head of <unk> prosecution <unk> <unk> to <unk> , adding that the additional details with respect to ongoing investigations can not be released .
the 00 - year - old <unk> was released by police after 00 hours .
due to a low of official information we can only <unk> how one could manipulate the tender .
a spokesman of the land fund <unk> <unk> replied to the question by <unk> that police actually made arrests at a <unk> workplace in <unk> , namely during the public <unk> procedure .
" it was a client , not our employee , " she said .
the public tender , according to <unk> <unk> , is called " invitation to tender for the transfer of land rights under the <unk> act " and takes place when more eligible candidates are interested in the land offered .
" these people within the call offer a higher value of their <unk> claims to be settled by the transfer than the announced value of the land . "
" by the claims offered the order of the <unk> is set and land fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims , " said fund spokesman .
mr <unk> g. probably had information , who replied to the call , and since he is also a beneficiary , because he has bought a number of <unk> claims , he suggested to another candidate not to participate .
the candidate probably received financial compensation .
that would explain that he was detained with such a large sum of money .
<unk> g had superior contacts to <unk> already in the past .
he <unk> in the case of former chief of <unk> <unk> <unk> , who was prosecuted for transferring <unk> in the <unk> land <unk> , on which a decision on the location of a building has already been issued .
it was just then when mr <unk> g. acquired <unk> intended for the construction of public roads from the fund , particularly at the point where the <unk> was to be built to the industrial zone <unk> <unk> .
later , he very <unk> exchanged those with the city for a house in the historic town <unk> , which had a much higher value .
town hall had to accept it then , because otherwise it would block the construction by blocking the <unk> .
households will pay extra hundreds for housing a month
households will have to pay more since january , not only for all types of energy , but also for water and <unk> , heating supplies , and <unk> will rise in certain areas .
families will have to pull out monthly hundreds more from <unk> from january .
the price of electricity will be raised up by 0.0 percent ; gas will be about 0 percent more expensive , in some towns you will have to pay extra for water by up to a tenth and supply of central heating will often be more expensive .
electricity price increase should cost <unk> s in the flats hundreds of crowns a year more than now .
prices of power energy were reduced by all the major suppliers at the same time ; a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources , especially <unk> , is to blame then .
although gas will only be slightly more expensive , it will happen when most people are heating their flats and thus have the highest consumption .
annually they must then also take extra costs in account .
while electricity and gas will be more expensive across the country , central heating price change varies from place to place .
price increase is planned mainly in larger municipalities .
for example , households in <unk> and <unk> <unk> will pay since january for central heating about <unk> 00 per month extra , families in <unk> will pay extra <unk> 0,000 a year .
residents of prague may have more expensive water and <unk> by more than 0 percent , in the event that the city increases the rent of the infrastructure .
if the rent does not change , prague residents will pay extra 0.0 percent .
price in prague , however , will still be in a <unk> comparison rather low .
in the north bohemia , where prices are already among the highest , the water rate should increase by about 0.0 percent .
for example , the price of rent in 000 thousands of rental <unk> , where regulation ends in january , may significantly increase .
for example , <unk> <unk> , which in <unk> <unk> <unk> owns about 0,000 <unk> , plans to raise the rent from january by up to one hundred percent .
the company intends to bring to the court those who will not accept the new <unk> .
regulated <unk> paid by people in approximately 000 thousand <unk> could increase by up to ten percent next year .
czech children get drunk with <unk> and rum . beer is out of fashion , it works slowly .
<unk> , rum , vodka , exceptionally better brand of <unk> stolen from parents .
these are the drinks , after which most often <unk> not even of the age of fifteen end in <unk> " care .
children who are treated for drunkenness at the hospital repeatedly are not an exception .
this follows the experience of <unk> who are confronted with similar cases in the admissions of patients to children departments of hospitals .
" beer or wine is completely <unk> , as it takes a long time before they get drunk . "
" <unk> is the trend of today , that is for sure , " said the head of children 's <unk> in <unk> hospital in central bohemia , <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
" if they can pull out a bottle of their father from the <unk> , it is usually the <unk> , but otherwise <unk> and vodka dominate . "
" vodka has the advantage that it is served in <unk> and they may not smell so badly then , " said the head <unk> .
and this is confirmed by the speaker of the <unk> hospital <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
" it is <unk> or rum most often . "
" it is today a modern spirit , especially in primary schools . "
" in some cases , it was a <unk> <unk> , which they have brought from home , " said <unk> .
according to the head <unk> <unk> are thirteen - or <unk> - year - old drinkers admitted to hospital a relatively common phenomenon .
before <unk> , where he has been since this year , he worked for ten years just in <unk> department in <unk> , where <unk> bring <unk> schoolchildren from the surrounding area .
" one <unk> was admitted to our hospital four times . "
" she started her career at the age of twelve , when she was brought to us with a 0.0 per <unk> of alcohol in the blood , in addition in combination with <unk> , " the doctor describes a particularly serious case .
" she had attended a dance party and <unk> . "
" it is interesting that her mother did not find at all strange that she had not seen her daughter for 00 hours , " said the chief <unk> .
it is the <unk> of parents or even their considerable tolerance to drinking problems of their own <unk> is considered a major cause of increasing children <unk> .
it is however not an addiction in the true sense in the case of children according to experts .
" under the term alcoholic we understand a multi - year chronic addiction to alcohol with all the related phenomena , which does not apply to children . "
" for those who use alcohol frequently , it is more associated with unsuccessful family - social background , " said the head <unk> <unk> .
according to <unk> <unk> about forty <unk> children have this year been <unk> at the <unk> <unk> in <unk> until mid - november .
the statistics , however , receive only those with severe <unk> who had to stay in the hospital .
child <unk> , who are taken home after <unk> treatment by their parents or the police , are not counted .
except where kids just sit around after school and drink a bottle of <unk> , according to <unk> , there are three seasonal fluctuations , which one can rely on : witch feast , new year and the end of the school year .
" it 's either to wash down the sadness from bad school report , conversely , to celebrate the start of the holiday . "
" but i experienced seven drunk children admitted to hospital at the same time during the witch feast " said <unk> .
the drunk , who spends the night with detoxification under medical supervision , is paradoxically in an advantage compared to that one at home , who suffers from unpleasant <unk> the next day .
morning <unk> caused by <unk> and lack of <unk> are prevented by irrigation <unk> with <unk> and nutrients that the body is lacking .
" they are actually doing better because they have the beautiful evening experience and a good wake up when nothing hurts . "
" only they are confused about where they are , " said <unk> , adding that he sometimes <unk> the pleasant mood of the patients by at least a list of costs that their treatment required .
transport by <unk> and being <unk> on an acute bed costs thousands of crowns .
" sometimes i used this as an educational measure , when i directly to those children calculated how much it cost that they became drunk , and that they could also spend the summer working to make money to cover this one party , " said <unk> .
insurance companies , however , do not take regression procedures in which the parents should cover the cost of treatment in cases of child <unk> .
two l - 000 aircrafts are in foreign hands for the first time in spain
two l - 000 of a total of five pieces for which the czech <unk> ministry has exchanged transport aircraft <unk> c - <unk> , <unk> on tuesday to <unk> , where is based the manufacturer of <unk> aircrafts - <unk> .
it is the first time that aircrafts of this type appeared in the possession of someone else than the czech army .
they have only been abroad for training and demonstration flights .
it is a two - seat version of the l - <unk> aircraft , which has been operated by czech army and were <unk> .
the remaining three are single - l - 000 .
those are still standing in <unk> <unk> and the broker - the company <unk> - took them over only last week .
it has not been released when the aircrafts will physically leave <unk> , according to jan <unk> of the press department of ministry of <unk> .
" single - seat l - 000 have been allocated for the exchange from long - stored aircraft , and without any deposits and investments by the ministry . "
" two - seat l - <unk> aircrafts were exchanged in the current condition and form , " <unk> told <unk> .
he added that the army will not be left without a two - seat aircraft , because in may 0000 the ministry signed a contract worth 000 million crowns with <unk> <unk> for the reconstruction of four redundant l - 000 machines into two two - seat machines .
one new aircraft was taken by the army in july ; the other will be taken over until the end of this year .
according to <unk> <unk> has committed to enforce the aircraft as equipment to some alliance countries .
" the contract clearly states that the purchaser of the l - 000 is the <unk> company and they will be used for training pilots from nato countries . "
" how to implement this thing is therefore an issue for customers " said <unk> .
<unk> <unk> recently reported that the spanish army is not interested in l - 000 .
the exchange of five l - 000 aircrafts for one <unk> aircraft and purchase of three more aircrafts worth 0.0 billion was approved by government of <unk> <unk> last year .
ministry of defence did not organize any tender for the purchase and addressed <unk> directly .
the former leadership of ministry of <unk> argued that the exchange would promote further exports of l - 000 abroad .
czech army has purchased 00 aircrafts from <unk> and uses only 00 ; they would like to sell the remaining ones .
purchase of <unk> aircrafts will probably have judicial implications .
the european commission has <unk> the czech ministry of defence at the european court because the aircrafts were to be selected on the basis of a european tender and not addressing only one manufacturer .
the army has already acquired three <unk> aircrafts , the last one should arrive in prague , airport <unk> , within a fortnight .
having index finger longer than ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
men who have a longer index finger than ring finger are at lower risk of prostate cancer .
it is a surprising conclusion of a study published on wednesday by the british journal of cancer .
this may be related to the level of the male <unk> <unk> .
" our results show that the relative finger length may serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk , especially for a man up to 00 years , " said study 's co - author <unk> <unk> , professor at the institute for cancer research at the university of <unk> .
the finger could then help determine which men should undergo tests for prostate cancer , particularly in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden , she said .
in the period 0000-0000 she along with her colleagues monitored more than 0,000 patients with prostate cancer in britain and in parallel over three thousand healthy men .
more than a half of the study participants had a shorter index finger on their right hand than their ring finger .
the same probability of prostate cancer applied to them as for 00 percent of those whose fingers were of equal length .
for those who have the index finger longer than ring finger this risk decreased by 00 percent , while for men up to their <unk> it was even an 00 percent decline .
the ratio of the length of those two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - probably reflects different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb .
less <unk> corresponds to a longer index finger .
previous studies have shown that it is the <unk> that supports prostate cancer development .
leading <unk> and former czech president of academy of sciences professor <unk> <unk> said for <unk> that he knows about the study but in his opinion the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer does not seem to be " fully proven . "

the generals hope that the new automatic <unk> will affect the conflict with the taliban and " change the game " in their <unk> .
the new weapon is like a <unk> small <unk> .
their <unk> is directed by a <unk> to hit within a few <unk> .
special ammunition <unk> 00 mm , designed for this <unk> and containing high explosive , in fact , act like little <unk> .
the <unk> can be <unk> to explode when hitting the target , but at any point of their <unk> path .
they can be used against an enemy who is hiding behind a barrier , behind walls or in trenches .
these are usually not protected from the above , and if hit by the rain of deadly <unk> of steel , they may not fight any more .
according to richard <unk> who participated in the development of <unk> - 00 <unk> , it is a new first weapon for the <unk> , which uses " smart " technology .
" the soldier basically operates it as follows : they find a target , it sends a <unk> <unk> to determine the distance and thus the precise explanation of the point , they adjust the <unk> and squeeze the trigger . "
" let 's say that you have obtained 000 <unk> . "
" when you squeeze the trigger , the <unk> charges , and fires a missile at a distance of 000 <unk> plus or minus one , two or three <unk> , " said <unk> .
000 jobs relocated
the <unk> corporation is <unk> its bad <unk> office to frankfurt .
in july of next year , 000 employees will move from the current office building on <unk> square in bad <unk> to frankfurt 's <unk> park .
the japanese <unk> corporation is <unk> its bad <unk> office to frankfurt .
the industry giant in computers and computer maintenance announced on wednesday that 000 men and women are to move from the current office building on <unk> square in bad <unk> to frankfurt 's <unk> park in july of next year . the <unk> park is a large office complex on <unk> street in frankfurt 's <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> explained that , in the medium term , a further 000 corporation employees currently spread across the region will join the frankfurt office .

<unk> had also only been <unk> the office in bad <unk> .
the manager responsible for the move , <unk> <unk> , said , " in frankfurt <unk> , we have found a central location with outstanding infrastructure . "
the excellent connection to the airport was of particular significance to a global company such as <unk> , he added .
yesterday the coming relocation of an important company within the region was a cause for joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers .
markus frank ( cdu ) , head of frankfurt 's department of economic affairs , said the city had once again attracted a global player ,
which was a " fantastic acknowledgement of the city . "
he believed the city would suit <unk> and that the move would be a significant boost for <unk> .
michael <unk> ( greens ) , mayor of bad <unk> , expressed his regret at <unk> 's decision .
he said the city had been informed of the intended move by the company 's management board well in advance .
" we offered the company our help , as a matter of course , " said <unk> .
the amicable meetings , however , had no effect on the difficulties between the computer manufacturer and the <unk> for the property on <unk> square .
economic reasons had finally tipped the balance .
<unk> now wants to focus on preventing such a prominent location from remaining vacant long - term .
" i hope the building 's <unk> and <unk> will cooperate . "
the building previously used by <unk> on the town hall square and the neighbouring low - rise " <unk> <unk> " were among a number of buildings on <unk> square that were part of the controversial building project by the spa town ten years ago .
the joint project between the city and a private project <unk> served to create a new entrance into the city between the train station and town hall , which attracted criticism on account of the massive scale of development over areas previously partly used for parking , and on account of the height of the buildings .
in 0000 , three companies moved in : <unk> , the investment <unk> management and rating company , start <unk> , the travel sales and marketing systems software manufacturer , and <unk> , the computer maker ( still linked to <unk> at the time ) .
the buildings used by <unk> were purchased in 0000 by the frankfurt - based <unk> group and the <unk> <unk> real estate fund and sold on to spanish <unk> real estate investments sa in madrid one year later .
the <unk> - based <unk> corporation <unk> itself as the third largest it provider in the world .
it provides companies with computers , servers and other equipment and provides necessary <unk> .
the office in the <unk> - main area is one of the largest in germany , although <unk> has considerably more employees in munich .
the <unk> subsidiary , technology solutions , is also moving from bad <unk> to frankfurt ; two further <unk> , <unk> services and a company named <unk> , will also be based in frankfurt .
0000 square metres have been rented in the <unk> park office building to accommodate them .
the twenty - year - old complex - its name inspired by the star - shaped ground plan - is already home to the central association of the german electrical and <unk> industry ( <unk> ) and other organisations .

<unk> is getting into deeper and deeper waters .

internet activists have lost access to their american <unk> and are now looking for an internet home in europe .
the prominent american <unk> <unk> <unk> called upon other countries and companies to boycott <unk> .
in the meantime , a newspaper report suggests <unk> founder <unk> <unk> , who is on <unk> 's wanted list , is currently in great britain .
" <unk> forced off amazon servers . "
" free speech in the land of the free , " said the <unk> blowing activists on wednesday ( local time ) via the <unk> <unk> service .
a short while previously , the internet company amazon had banned <unk> documents from its servers .
the internet activists had used the amazon web service ( <unk> ) to publish secret diplomatic <unk> in order to be able to cope with the high number of people accessing the documents .
<unk> discussed the step on <unk> : " great - we 'll spend our dollars employing people in europe instead . "
if amazon had issues with freedom of speech , " it should give up selling books . "
amazon stopped <unk> using its servers after colleagues of <unk> <unk> <unk> started to investigate , reported the <unk> <unk> , quoting <unk> 's office .
the chairman of the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs had threatened to boycott amazon , reported the british newspaper " the guardian . "

the ice cream university
ice cream <unk> are being trained for the warm <unk> at the " <unk> university " in bologna .
the three - day foundation course for future " <unk> " is the largest course , and welcomes visitors from all over the world .
where does all that ice cream actually come from ?
from the " <unk> " and the " <unk> . "
the " <unk> , " known in english as the old - <unk> " ice cream <unk> , " produces the cream following the rules of the italian art of ice cream making .
the " <unk> " gets the ice cream out of the <unk> counter with a <unk> , <unk> it into <unk> and <unk> it .
you do not need to go to <unk> <unk> in the province of bologna to know that .
but for anyone who wants to know more about ice cream , the " <unk> university " of the italian <unk> company is a must .
the ice cream university was created by the manufacturer of ice cream makers in 0000 to ensure that the ice cream from all its makers met exacting italian standards .
the three - day foundation course for future " <unk> " is the largest course , and welcomes visitors from all over the world .
there are also specialised courses over several days covering <unk> ice cream , and <unk> in the company 's own ice cream <unk> .
many dream of a new career to escape a mid - life crisis ; others come to test their vague aspirations against the cold facts .
this time , there are 00 participants from 00 countries and every continent - from brazil and hungary to saudi arabia .
<unk> , an art teacher from california , <unk> the slow food movement and wants to offer a high - quality european product in a country accustomed to industrial ice cream .
<unk> from berlin is a management consultant and wants to do something on her own after years in a highly stressful job .
two young <unk> girls dream of opening an ice cream <unk> in cairo .
one man from malta and another from brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and canadian <unk> julia has come because her children love italian ice cream .
<unk> <unk> luciano ferrari begins the course by describing the ideal characteristics of a perfect ice cream .
not only a good flavour , but <unk> <unk> and good <unk> are key .
training the course , luciano does not forget to mention the real <unk> on the <unk> for the national and thoroughly southern <unk> . " italian <unk> is simply the best - after that , it 's all just <unk> . "
the first step of production seems very easy .
luciano pours the basic ingredients - milk , cream , <unk> milk , sugar and <unk> - into a large <unk> that <unk> the mixture to 00 degrees on an electronic programme and then immediately <unk> it to four degrees .
then he turns a tap on the machine and out comes a <unk> , basic white ice cream , the basic for all milk - based ice <unk> .
the lecturer is immediately overwhelmed by questions . can you make ice cream using natural ingredients only without <unk> ?
how can you experiment freely on your own ?
luciano warns against letting the spirit of the age lead you <unk> .
anyone who talks about making ice cream " using natural ingredients only " has probably used <unk> anyway - in most cases a natural product such as <unk> <unk> from <unk> beans .
of course , you can make ice cream without <unk> , but then you have to sell it within a day , as otherwise it collapses and your customer ends up <unk> <unk> of ice .
some variations to the base are allowed .
it gets more exciting with the <unk> .
for ice cream flavouring , <unk> luciano <unk> between the ingredients you buy in the fruit section and in the sweet section of the supermarket .
there are also <unk> and <unk> .
" all suppliers will try to get you to get you to buy dozens of <unk> additives .
but you should just experiment . "
either with fruit <unk> using sugar and fresh fruits ,
or with a white ice cream base that can be turned into yellow cream by using <unk> or can be mixed with <unk> powder to form the base of all kinds of <unk> <unk> .
at last the course participants are allowed onto the ice cream maker .
luciano lets each of them make four different types of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ice cream - with or without <unk> in the base and with more or less <unk> flavouring or other natural ingredients .
the experiment is repeated with the range of fruit <unk> .
more <unk> , more fruit <unk> - not necessarily an improvement in taste .
<unk> ice cream does not necessarily taste more <unk> when it contains more <unk> .
the team that produces the most popular <unk> ice cream uses more fruit , less water and a little less of the <unk> .
the taste of a <unk> only really stands out if the mixture is balanced , says luciano .
making ice cream is a matter of <unk> . if <unk> <unk> <unk> is used , the proportion of sugar in the basic <unk> has to be reduced .
an extra portion of sugar is needed for <unk> ice cream .
luciano brings out a device that shows him the sugar content of the types of fruit ( <unk> use it to measure the density of <unk> must using the <unk> scale ) .
fortunately , tables make the calculations easier .
making ice cream does not require as much physical activity as it once did .
it is not just the machine , which produces the base .
there is also a device that <unk> the finished ice cream mixture to a <unk> consistency while cooling it to negative temperatures .
but despite all <unk> , minor accidents still occur .
the brazilian <unk> covers himself and his course mates from head to <unk> with fruit <unk> as he loses control of the <unk> hand - held <unk> .
" in every course , " says <unk> luciano , " it is only a matter of time before something like this happens . "
<unk> in the <unk>
there are allegations that the european food safety authority ( efsa ) has been infiltrated by the genetically modified crop industry .
the <unk> centre of expertise , which sees itself as an independent institute for assessing the impact of <unk> , has made the accusation .
" it sounds like a conspiracy theory , but we have good documentary evidence , " said head of <unk> , <unk> then , in munich on wednesday .
<unk> <unk> , chair of efsa 's expert panel responsible for the risk assessment of genetically <unk> plants and another efsa expert are also believed to have been working with the lobby group <unk> for years .
<unk> receives funds from corporations such as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> has had a central role in developing the efsa test specifications for gm plants and therefore has a clear conflict of interests , says then .
in places , the efsa regulations are identical to position papers produced by <unk> and thus are being written by the very industry that the authority , based in the italian city of <unk> , should be controlling , argues then ,
pointing out that this is the second time <unk> has criticised a conflict of interests .
a high - ranking efsa manager recently moved to the swiss agribusiness company <unk> without any restrictions or a transitional period being imposed , and is now on the other side of the line .
<unk> radio has also recently uncovered personal connections between the eu supervisory authority and the industry lobby , which has caught the attention of the environment agency and eu parliamentarians .
however , efsa does not see any conflict of interests .
in a statement , efsa said that all significant data were considered , including data from industry , if such data were of a high professional quality .
in addition , efsa stated that it had no requirement that its panels avoid all contact with industry .
however , all members of efsa must disclose any such contact .
<unk> admits to working for the international life sciences institute ( <unk> ) in the usa .
the institute describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science , industry and politics to assess the risks around <unk> and other areas - without a lobbying mandate .
in this field , independent experts such as then express criticism that genetically modified plants are currently approved for animals without feeding trials and that the reaction of gm plants to environmental influences is not being investigated .
" for example , we want to know what genetically modified corn does in fields , " says then .
current practice is only to test isolated proteins , but not the entire gm plant , which does not provide reliable results .
" if you do n't look for the risks , how are you supposed to find them ? , " asks then .
angelika <unk> shares his opinion .
the scientist has been carrying out research into gm technology since 0000 and is currently working at <unk> <unk> .
the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit <unk> critical scientists in this field in europe , as in the usa , says <unk> .
there are hardly any researchers left without ties to corporations , she believes ,
and studies criticising companies are not normally published .
" the industry is controlling safety research , " says <unk> .
the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> has got hold of some - in total , around 000 <unk> .
on monday evening , he was standing in front of stuttgart train station , his <unk> on his back .
there was a demonstration .
it was <unk> .
the tale is a familiar one . in september , the <unk> arrived and had begun to break up a large section of the north wing .
stuttgart was not the same . thousands and thousands of people demonstrated against s 00 , the multi - billion euro sinking of the train station .
by the time work was suspended , a large proportion of the wing was <unk> .
broken into 0000 or 0000 pieces .
<unk> shell <unk> , a <unk> coarse stone , <unk> between 0000 and 0000 .
00 - year - old <unk> is a <unk> in <unk> .
he got hold of a few chunks .
" these <unk> are <unk> . "
" they will not disappear . "
he <unk> : " a cheap and poor stone , simple and <unk> . "
when he cut one out , it <unk> of cigarette <unk> .
he still does not know what he will do with the chunks of stone .
<unk> have plenty of time .
as does <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of the stuttgart <unk> leads to a forest in <unk> and a former french munitions <unk> where manuel <unk> has created his own world of stone .
the 00 - year - old trades in old <unk> .
he has bought every stone from the <unk> in stuttgart .
" it would be a crime if they were ground into <unk> or disappeared into <unk> , " he says in his office , a small wooden <unk> that was once a <unk> box .
people insulted and threatened him , he recalls , when the newspapers reported in september that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the <unk> contractor .
he talked with the opponents of the stuttgart 00 development project for days on end .
he explained that there was nothing he could do about the <unk> .
and if it were going to happen , then the most sensible thing was that the <unk> were used again for other purposes .
in response , around 000 stuttgart 00 opponents took a block away with them , each weighing an average of 00 <unk> and costing 0.00 to 00 euros .
some as a <unk> , but others in the hope of being able to return the blocks if the building is rebuilt .
<unk> had bought 000 tonnes - equivalent to 00 truck - loads .
about half is stored in the forest , but the rest has been sold long ago .
gardeners , landscape gardeners and <unk> .
they came from everywhere and took away whatever they could carry in car <unk> and trailers .
the stuttgart <unk> of scandal have long since been transformed into walls , or boundaries for <unk> gardens .
" actually , this stone is nothing special , " says <unk> .
" if it did n't have political significance . "
he <unk> into his off - <unk> and does a tour of his realm of 00 hectares .
he studied law but switched to <unk> , then he got interested in computers , and finally became a stone <unk> .
and a stone <unk> .
he stores 00,000 tonnes of stone .
he <unk> his treasure from all over germany .
and claims to be the largest used stone <unk> in the country .
he brakes .
<unk> <unk> <unk> are lying in the snow .
" they used to be part of dresden 's <unk> , " he says .
<unk> <unk> , yellow and warm , he says .
" my favourite stone . "
the route then continues upwards through the forest .
he points to a pile : red <unk> , previously part of karlsruhe train station .
and more .
" beautiful <unk> . "
the blocks once <unk> to the stands of stuttgart 's <unk> stadium .
the snow is full of <unk> and stories - stuttgart <unk> from stuttgart police headquarters , red <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> from <unk> hospital .
so much work , so much effort , so much <unk> .
when <unk> thinks about how the <unk> used to be <unk> by hand and moved with simply <unk> and <unk> , he feels a great sense of <unk> .
" it would be a scandal to shred all this . "
he has n't become rich , but he has found some <unk> <unk> .
the stone <unk> currently employs 00 people and <unk> , <unk> , a smith , a glass <unk> and a <unk> have also set up in the forest .
" we work hard , but it is satisfying , " says the used stone <unk> .
he has to go to cologne soon .
there are <unk> to be rescued there as well .
talent war for graduates with potential
there is a rush on at the <unk> .
00 students are <unk> their way to <unk> rolls , <unk> <unk> and desert .
the technical university of <unk> and the car maker <unk> have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop .
they are going talk shop on the car of the future with <unk> <unk> in a kind of idea <unk> - and , incidentally , find out more about <unk> .
many companies are already engaged in hand - to - hand combat in the <unk> for the <unk> minds , and are relying on cooperation with universities , just like <unk> .
their mission : to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the <unk> hall - before they come onto the job market and are <unk> by anyone else .
and because universities do not provide a breakdown of student performance , companies are looking for and hoping to attract exceptional talent in hands - on projects .
on the second day of the workshop at the technical university of <unk> , the car maker it out to <unk> the talent .
a young woman from human resources distributes ballpoint pens , <unk> bears and <unk> bearing the <unk> logo .
she tells the young <unk> about <unk> and student jobs , and explains the various routes into the company .
nico <unk> from the technical university of <unk> is managing the project with <unk> .
he sees advantages for both sides . " the students get in contact with industry and gain some experience . "
" <unk> can get to know students while taking a closer look at interesting candidates and thinking about which ones are their potential employees . "
such cooperation , thinks <unk> , is not unusual .
what is new is that students are being touted so aggressively .
" the focus used to be on <unk> - specific projects , " says <unk> .
the fight for the latest batch of graduates is set to be a lot tougher .
in many sectors , companies can no longer identify their employees from the <unk> of applicants .
they really have to sell themselves to win over highly qualified graduates .
graduates in engineering find themselves particularly well placed for negotiation .
according to the association of german engineers ( <unk> ) , more than 00,000 engineering jobs were <unk> in october .
and the shortage of engineers is going to get worse , according to <unk> .
roman <unk> is on the hunt for talent for <unk> , the audit , tax and advisory services firm .
he <unk> lavish recruitment events such as the <unk> race , a kind of modern <unk> hunt where participants have to find their route using gps coordinates .
the company wants to send eight promising students straight across the usa next year .
and quite incidentally , the participants will see <unk> branches and get to know the company .
who gets to go is decided in two advance selection rounds .
only the <unk> de la <unk> of the many applicants will fly to the usa .
<unk> all the war <unk> surrounding university graduates with potential , the <unk> <unk> from some companies are getting louder and louder , says <unk> .
" with this race , we want to stand out from the <unk> . "
" just one trip was n't enough for us . "
for talent - <unk> <unk> , the sums add up .
" to this day , we have stayed in contact with all the participants of a similar campaign last year . "
" some of them are just about to <unk> and expect to apply to us soon , " he says .
besides direct <unk> on <unk> , small and medium - sized businesses especially are <unk> candidates at classic career <unk> .
" we try to reach graduates at <unk> . "
" for example , at <unk> , " says <unk> <unk> , head of human resources at the solar technology manufacturer , <unk> .
the <unk> - based company employs around 0000 people in germany .
<unk> is well aware of the problem of attracting young talent .
there are currently 00 vacancies on the company website .
" it is really very difficult to fill vacant positions . "
" it costs a lot of time and money , " she says .
another route is contact via university <unk> .
<unk> is cooperating with a number of universities , including <unk> university .
" the <unk> point out that the students can do <unk> or write their <unk> with us . "
expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists are not in the pipeline .
on the other hand , the company is trying to advertise with its other advantages , including a relaxed working atmosphere , flat <unk> and straightforward communication .
" a big corporation cannot often offer that , " says human resources manager <unk> .
money has not been the key factor in the job market for a while .
flexible working time , <unk> and good promotion opportunities are also decisive factors .
<unk> came in 00th place among the 000 best employers in germany in a study by the great place to work institute .
the institute publishes an annual league table of german employers .
it asks employees how happy they are with their work and job environment and looks at the general working conditions .
human resources manager <unk> hopes to score points with job - seekers thanks to the company 's place on the list .
" i think that applicants are influenced strongly by external assessments of any potential employer , " she says .
<unk> <unk> <unk> from the german employer branding academy is an <unk> for companies seeking to develop a reputation as a good employer as part of a long - term strategy .
he <unk> his clients to be more authentic .
and that actually means internal changes , says <unk> .
" the best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is via your own employees , " he says .
in industry jargon , that means employer branding among your own employees .
" happy employees are the best ambassadors . "
if you treat your own well and they identify with the company , then they will find you new employees among their friends and <unk> .
" it 's like playing in a <unk> , " says <unk> .
<unk> stops new oil <unk>
there will be no new <unk> off the coast of the us federal state of <unk> in the gulf of mexico in the coming year .
the government in washington has published a prohibition to that effect - thereby definitively scrapping earlier plans .
new <unk> is also forbidden off the atlantic coast for the immediate future .
secretary of the interior <unk> <unk> made the announcement on wednesday .
the explosion of the <unk> <unk> <unk> platform in april was the trigger for the strict prohibition , which is to remain in force for at least the next five years .
before the disaster that cost eleven workers their lives and led to the usa 's biggest environmental disaster , president <unk> <unk> , under pressure from the opposition and industry , had signalled his readiness to allow new <unk> in the eastern area of the gulf of mexico .
<unk> had hoped this would reduce the usa 's dependency on foreign oil supplies .
who will bear responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the gulf has still not been conclusively decided .
the british energy company bp is the focus of criticism , and is faced with claims for billions of dollars .
a board of inquiry set up by president <unk> is set to submit its findings at some point in december .
in october , secretary of the interior <unk> <unk> had revoked the prohibition on <unk> imposed after the explosion .
in response , various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new <unk> projects .
<unk> and <unk> want to rule out any further catastrophe with tougher controls and stricter safety regulations .
the responsible control authority , which fell into disrepute after numerous accusations of corruption , is being extensively reformed .
at the same time , the president has announced that lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies will be stopped .
the industry is warning publicly that the output in the gulf will be significantly lower than in the past if regulation is tougher .
" the government 's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry , " is the outcome of a recent industry survey by the <unk> firm <unk> - even before the prohibition on <unk> was put in place on wednesday .
the american energy alliance also complains of the uncertainty faced by the industry . " no one knows what exactly will change in terms of regulation . "
the organisation believes investment in new projects will be suspended indefinitely - at the expense of growth .
<unk> has burnt down
the water in the rivers is oil - brown and <unk> like a petrol station . billions of litres of leaked crude oil have destroyed the natural environment of <unk> in nigeria .
people are living on theft , corruption and <unk> illegal oil .
<unk> <unk> sees the positive side .
" do n't worry , " the <unk> tells journalists . " you 'll see plenty of oil sludge to photograph today . "
the 00 - year - old nigerian was trying to photograph a boy <unk> up to his <unk> in the water - and the <unk> of water around him . in the <unk> - <unk> water , the scene is almost beautiful .
the brown <unk> of crude oil under the surface are invisible .
<unk> <unk> used to fill <unk> with <unk> at the bank of the <unk> <unk> river .
now , the stagnant waters are completely dead .
five years ago , massive quantities of crude oil flooded out of a burst oil pipeline into the vast <unk> .
fishermen from the nearby town of <unk> now have to <unk> six hours to get to water inhabited by fish . <unk> , in the heart of the niger delta , is one of the most contaminated regions in the world .
on the journey through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> - crossed by river courses , the full extent of the devastation is plain to see .
instead of clear water , the <unk> <unk> up a brown <unk> ; if you put your hand in the water it comes out <unk> in oil .
the roots of the <unk> trees stick out from the ground like black <unk> sticks . the odd <unk> among the <unk> hangs its <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of birds <unk> in wetlands are nowhere to be seen . as soon as the <unk> motor falls silent , a devastating quiet <unk> over the former paradise that now <unk> like a petrol station .
" what is happening here is ecological <unk> , " says <unk> <unk> , <unk> . " we are living with a permanent hazard to health . "
the comparison to war is <unk> .
the region of the <unk> has been a <unk> <unk> for decades . more than 00 years ago , the first explorers from europe made their way to the region . in the 00s , the first wave of resistance was organised around the author <unk> <unk> - <unk> , who was later executed . it was here that the shell company had to stop production in 0000 , because it was too dangerous for its oil workers .
even today , the company is prohibited from returning to <unk> . while more than two million <unk> of black gold are <unk> every day from the delta region as a whole - which is an area three times the size of switzerland with more than 0000 <unk> and 0000 kilometres of pipeline - the <unk> in <unk> lie fallow , the situation too unstable for the oil company .
every few hundred metres , steel <unk> rise from the water like bizarre <unk> . the heads of <unk> are far too <unk> referred to as " little christmas trees . "
these structures can be up to 00 years old and most of them are seriously <unk> .
one <unk> after the next falls apart , says <unk> , then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water .
according to expert estimates , more than two billion litres have flown into the delta 's ecosystem in 00 years . year on year , that is the same amount of oil that rushed into the sea off <unk> when the <unk> <unk> <unk> crashed 00 years ago - one of the largest environmental catastrophes in human history .
there is dispute over who should be held responsible for the ongoing worst case scenario of ecological disaster .
whilst the shell company says <unk> and organised theft of oil are responsible for more than 00 percent of the contamination , environmentalists believe burst <unk> heads and <unk> pipelines are the main cause .
in 0000 , the us academic richard <unk> accused shell of applying significantly lower safety standards in nigeria than in the rest of the world . the rate of defects in pipelines alone was " several times higher than elsewhere . "
human figures emerge from the <unk> <unk> , that from a distance look deserted , oil - covered outside <unk> . the figures are stark naked and covered to the neck in oil .
under one of the many <unk> - some connected to pipes , others <unk> at random over the ground - there is a a <unk> fire . an illegal mini refinery .
michael , the group leader , explains that the crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours .
first , <unk> is <unk> off to a collecting pan , then kerosene <unk> from the end of the <unk> and finally , <unk> .
michael and four assistants produce up to four 000 - litre <unk> of <unk> a day in this way . " we get 00,000 <unk> for it " - about 00 dollars .
the inhabitants of the delta use the chronic fuel shortage to their advantage in the largest crude oil state of sub - saharan africa .
nigeria has just one refinery of its own .
the illegal <unk> can still <unk> the absurdly low <unk> prices of 00 euro cents per litre . they get their raw material for nothing .
the material comes from " <unk> " who tap the pipeline network all the way across <unk> . over the entire niger delta , experts estimate the country loses at least 00 millions litres of crude oil a day in this way .
however , only a tiny proportion of the raw material stored by <unk> goes on to be refined illegally . organised criminal networks with politicians and high - ranking officers amongst their ranks fill tankers with the lion 's share and <unk> it on the global market .
the activist <unk> believes the debate around whether the environmental catastrophe is the result of the activities of the population or lax production safety standards is purely academic .
" if the oil companies were not perceived as <unk> and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the fishermen 's livelihood , there would not be any <unk> , theft or illegal refineries . "
<unk> explains that the relationship between the <unk> towards shell in particular has been destroyed to such an extent that only withdrawal by the company is an option . " perhaps other nations such as the chinese will prove to be a better option . "
michael turns <unk> .
" it 's time you disappear , " says the <unk> oil man .
" the soldiers might turn up at any minute . "
if the illegal oil refiners are caught by the army 's task force , they are not likely to be jailed , but will have to pay <unk> <unk> .
it seems that the soldiers , who mainly originate from the north of the country , also want to profit from oil , like all other <unk> .
" this <unk> stuff has brought our country to rock bottom in every way , " says <unk> .
<unk> uncover dangerous defect in a 000 engines
the a 000 , it seems , has a major safety issue .
during examination of a plane following an emergency landing , <unk> have discovered a possible defect that could cause " catastrophic engine failure . "
the airline <unk> is now preparing to take the engine manufacturer to court .
the passengers of the <unk> airbus that was forced to land at the beginning of november appear to have had considerably more luck than anyone realised . during its investigations , the australian air safety authority identified a serious safety issue in the engines of some a 000 planes - and is now warning of a possible construction defect .
the alleged defect would have serious consequences . in a statement published on thursday , the australian transport safety bureau ( <unk> ) revealed that the defect could potentially cause <unk> cracks and leaks in an oil <unk> connection .
this could lead to " catastrophic engine failure . "
00 different a 000 aeroplanes with rolls - <unk> engines may be affected .
the <unk> airbus that was forced to land in singapore on 0 november was one of those aeroplanes .
the australian airline is now taking legal steps against the british turbine manufacturer .
it has submitted a claim to an australian federal court in <unk> which leaves open further potential legal measures against the company .
the ceo of <unk> , alan <unk> , said that his airline would demand compensation for the incident which occurred at the beginning of november .
the heat of the engine had caused parts to become <unk> and had damaged the <unk> .
rolls - <unk> believes an oil fire caused the damage .
following the incident , up to 00 engines around the world must now be replaced .
the australian <unk> announced that they will be carrying out further safety tests on the <unk> fitted with the affected engines .
<unk> speaker martin <unk> said that the safety recommendation was the result of cooperation with rolls - <unk> .
the safety issue was considered sufficiently serious for all affected parties to be informed .
after the forced landing of the <unk> plane , the airline grounded its a 000 fleet for weeks .
singapore airlines temporarily kept about three of its eleven a 000 on the ground .
<unk> replaced the engine in one a 000 as a <unk> .
the double - decker is the largest passenger plane in the world .

deutsche bank seeking <unk> for its twin <unk>
deutsche bank wants to sell its emblem . according to a newspaper report , the bank is looking for buyers for the two office high - rises at its frankfurt headquarters .
the property could fetch up to 000 million euros .

thousands mourn lost friends
more than 00,000 people in new zealand have attended a memorial service for the miners declared dead after a series of <unk> .
it has not yet been possible to recover the bodies , as the safety situation in the <unk> where the accident happened remains precarious .
almost two weeks ago , a violent explosion occurred in the <unk> river mine near the city of <unk> .
00 miners aged between 00 and 00 were buried alive below ground .
a probe was lowered into the <unk> , but no signs of the <unk> were discovered .
owing to the high concentration of poisonous gases and further subsequent <unk> , no <unk> were allowed into the <unk> for safety reasons .
after the second violent detonation , the authorities and experts acted on the assumption that there was no chance any of the miners had survived .
it has not yet been possible to recover the bodies .
family members and friends remembered the dead in a memorial service .
in bright sunshine , ten thousand people gathered in <unk> on new zealand 's south island .
they held a two - minute silence .
00 tables were set up in honour of the buried miners , displaying <unk> , <unk> and their names .
pictures and personal items , including clothing and <unk> , were also on display .
the flags were flying at half <unk> at all government buildings in the country .
new zealand had hoped that the miners would come back " from the depths of the earth " to the surface , said the prime minister of new <unk> john key to the crowds at the memorial .
" but they never came home . "
<unk> drew , father of trapped coal <unk> <unk> drew , said that he could not come to terms with the death of his son until he had seen his body .
several foreign diplomats took part in the memorial service alongside the prime minister and members of victims " families .
british and south african miners were also buried alive in the first explosion on 00 november .
<unk> began by <unk> a fire inside the coal mine on new zealand 's south island .
<unk> <unk> <unk> told journalists that work would begin to <unk> the <unk> temperatures inside the mine as soon as the explosive gases had been displaced .
to hell , <unk> !
is there a place for gore in art house cinema ?
the film director nicolas <unk> <unk> is testing old <unk> boundaries <unk> with his <unk> epic " <unk> rising . "
what audience was the danish director nicolas <unk> <unk> thinking of when he was shooting " <unk> rising " ?
a captured <unk> <unk> with only one eye ( <unk> <unk> ) <unk> his <unk> and <unk> down his opponents with almost superhuman powers - which sounds ideal for young male <unk> on the search for gore and action , particularly as our hero has a preference for brutal killing methods and is not <unk> to tearing out the <unk> from the living bodies of his enemies when he is in a bad mood .
on the other hand , one - eye , as he is actually called , does not say a word during the entire film , and even the other figures are only induced to say one or two sentences at most , or to emit a few <unk> death <unk> .
otherwise , the film is silent , <unk> in the <unk> beautiful hills of scotland that provides the <unk> for the <unk> world of around a thousand years ago .
more suited to adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in <unk> and very smooth tracking <unk> .
great when a film has several target groups , but a shame if they are mutually exclusive .
since his wild and <unk> drug <unk> <unk> " <unk> , " director <unk> <unk> has been seen as a kind of danish version of <unk> <unk> , but <unk> refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream by using a little more <unk> or to the art house by displaying less brutality .
most art cinema enthusiasts would be deterred by the <unk> matter and <unk> flying around .
if they have not already done so , action <unk> will die of <unk> when one - eye - for somewhat indecipherable reasons - sets off by ship to jerusalem with a troop of violent christian missionaries , ending up stuck for what seems like an eternity in dead <unk> and <unk> before the crew arrives in what is clearly america - where the silence continues .
no wonder then that ' <unk> rising " has not found a cinema distributor in germany and has only appeared on <unk> .
this is a shame , particularly because the <unk> is superb , but also because at times there is a <unk> work of cinema behind the <unk> , at times bloody <unk> - and that work of cinema deserves some attention .
this film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot , but all about atmosphere - a <unk> dream that has become a film .
for the <unk> , there is no escape from that dream .
<unk> hardly allows the <unk> a single moment of relaxation and slowly <unk> the same view with his iron images and the <unk> <unk> - like <unk> - and the incomprehensible hatred that strikes out at the <unk> from the hearts of the <unk> .
only one small <unk> boy who stands <unk> at one - eye 's side retains anything of innocence - all other <unk> are driven by fury .
above all , it is the one - <unk> hero who is driven by fury - whose motives are never explained , but who at some point becomes the <unk> from hell for his enemies and temporary allies alike , and perhaps even the messenger of the devil himself .
he equals <unk> , but perhaps only for the already <unk> .
" <unk> rising " is an <unk> film that people will hate and admire , to their <unk> , <unk> and amazement .
an experience .
mysterious <unk>
the international atomic energy agency ( <unk> ) has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in syria .
the country is refusing to comment - but is allowing inspections .
towards midnight on the night of 0th to 0th september 0000 , at least four israeli f - 00 i <unk> jets attacked a mysterious , cube - shaped building in syria .
it stands on the banks of the <unk> river ; the next major city , 00 kilometres away , is <unk> <unk> .
the name turns up in <unk> documents when there is mention of the reactor syria is alleged to have built in the cube - shaped building hidden in a <unk> cut off from the country 's electricity network - with aid from north korea .
according to a briefing from the us foreign intelligence service , the cia , at the end of april 0000 , the reactor , commonly referred to by the name of the nearest settlement el <unk> , could be used to produce <unk> - which could in turn be used to build atomic bombs .
the technology from the <unk> is of very little use for any other purpose .
the cia gave a video presentation with <unk> satellite images .
using computer <unk> , the agency showed where the components of the reactor are believed to have been located before its destruction - the reactor is said to be a smaller copy of the north <unk> model from the atomic centre in <unk> .
they agency also produced <unk> showing the building close up , and even its interior .
the reactor is believed to have been almost ready for commissioning , but not yet supplied with fuel <unk> .
now , more than three years after the <unk> , almost no more is known . in fact , the questions seem to have increased with time .
the former us president george <unk> bush has recently revealed in his <unk> that , although the cia had known before the attack that syria was building a reactor in el <unk> , it had not discovered any signs that there was " an active nuclear weapons programme " in the country .
many intelligence officials in europe are even more sceptical and speak only of an " alleged reactor , " even if they believe the cia presentation was " plausible . "
they lack hard evidence , as does the <unk> .
asked how certain he is that a reactor exists this summer , a high - ranking un diplomat replied <unk> that the <unk> had " enough material to pose questions . "
the <unk> , in any case , rapidly removed the <unk> of the supposedly " unused military building " and levelled the area completely .
nonetheless , in june 0000 , an <unk> team led by chief inspector <unk> <unk> discovered traces of man - made uranium in el <unk> .
in addition , the <unk> obtained <unk> produced satellite images from a member state from the period immediately preceding the attack - images said to be more convincing that the images presented by the cia .
however , the images were not available on the market , as the unknown customer - israel , perhaps - has purchased them exclusively .
hence , the <unk> cannot independently verify their authenticity .
syria has claimed never to have had a secret atomic programme or to have built a reactor .
<unk> claims the uranium was from israeli weapons .
however , after analysing the particles , the <unk> rejected the claim as <unk> .
since then , <unk> has avoided discussion on this point - or on the satellite images .
syria has also prevented <unk> carrying out a second inspection in el <unk> or to access the <unk> of the bombed building .
israel is also maintaining a <unk> silence .
" we will never comment on this , " said the former prime minister <unk> olmert , in office at the time of the attack , confirming the official position .
so the investigation has continued since june 0000 without conclusion and " is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority , " according to a high - ranking western diplomat at the <unk> headquarters in vienna - ultimately , a serious infringement of the non - proliferation treaty remains unresolved in the hands of the <unk> .
the <unk> clearly believes the key to moving forward in this process lies in three additional facilities that are supposed to have had a " functional connection " with the alleged reactor - and in contrast to the reactor , still exist .
however , <unk> have not so far disclosed the nature of the facilities or what function they have or what makes them seem <unk> .
according to information provided by the <unk> <unk> , they are referred to internally at the <unk> as <unk> as - <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , referring to towns nearby .
the independent institute for science and international security in washington ( <unk> ) has identified these locations and found a complex of buildings on satellite images at <unk> which is very probably one of the <unk> buildings .
it may be located in or immediately next to a military base - it is precisely for this reason that syria is refusing the <unk> access to the three locations .
in vienna , there is word that the <unk> were afraid of some kind of fishing <unk> and worry that the <unk> is being sent out by the usa as a vanguard to <unk> out military facilities .
this fear was exacerbated by the fact that nuclear <unk> had been tipped off about the facilities by the us secret services .
the <unk> has documents , including satellite <unk> , which suggest that material has been transported between the three locations and the cube - shaped building on the <unk> river .
a high - ranking western diplomat in vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be " related to fuel production . "
however , there were " no signs of sensitive activities " such as uranium enrichment or <unk> - processes that are required to build atomic weapons .
this type of reactor is fuelled by uranium , but not enriched uranium .
however , a reasonable guess could be made as to where the uranium came from and where the <unk> from that uranium would be extracted for use in a bomb .
it remains unclear , however , whether <unk> that could contain valuable trace deposits has been stored at the three locations .
no one is admitting to having any information on where the <unk> has ended up , as if hundreds of <unk> of earth had simply vanished into thin air .
the salt mine of al <unk> , located just several kilometres from el <unk> on the other side of the <unk> and investigated by syria in 0000 as a possible storage location for radioactive waste is an unlikely location , according to the <unk> .
the former <unk> inspector robert <unk> recently connected the mine and the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the <unk> magazine , <unk> 's intelligence review .
images from <unk> , however , show that syria undertook <unk> at the three suspected locations and removed large <unk> after the <unk> had demanded access .
that may be coincidence , but has done nothing to clear suspicion .
there is also talk in diplomatic circles of the <unk> having spent a number of months developing an inspections plan that would allow syria to protect any military secrets - the costs alone shows the extent of the <unk> " interest .
<unk> , however , also <unk> off this proposal .
although western diplomats in vienna had offered reassurance , by saying that since the reactor was destroyed the issue had low priority , the us ambassador <unk> davies has been bringing so - called special inspections to the table , which is one of the most powerful instruments available to the vienna - based atomic authority to carry out inspections .
<unk> <unk> , current director general of the <unk> , who is believed to have suggested the inspection , has already spoken of " an option that i am open to in the future , " but is still hesitating .
the option is high risk . on the one hand it requires a majority in the governing council of the <unk> , and a number of the 00 countries represented are anything other than eager for escalation .
on the other hand , as one diplomat points out , " what if , in the end , they find nothing ? "
love in times of war
since <unk> <unk> began working on her as yet anonymous directing <unk> in the summer , there has been trouble .
she wrote the script herself - a love story between a woman from bosnia and a serbian man .
no one really knows much more than that - but that alone is enough to cause <unk> .
the rumour stubbornly persists that the woman - a muslim - falls in love with her serbian <unk> during the <unk> war .
bosnian women 's organisations have protested immediately , in response to which several days of shooting planned in sarajevo were moved to hungary at short notice .
since then , the film has been shot in hungary and is in post - production , but there are still protests in bosnia .
<unk> <unk> from the association of women victims of war wrote to <unk> via the un refugee agency unhcr and demanded a meeting with the <unk> , reported a bosnian newspaper - <unk> herself is an ambassador for the un agency .
however , she can hardly be described as diplomatic - <unk> offered to meet the women weeks ago in hungary , but they declined .
the meeting must take place in bosnia , insists <unk> .
according to <unk> , there were no love stories in rape camps , and <unk> 's behaviour towards victims told her enough about the script .
according to the un refugee organisation , her organisation has recommended <unk> <unk> as an ambassador , reports the guardian .
but what kind of script exactly has <unk> written ?
the bosnian ministry of culture that read her script issued a permit for shooting in sarajevo after some to - <unk> and <unk> - <unk> - it is not entirely clear why <unk> then did not go to bosnia .
they fledgling writer herself asserts that she has no political motives in her film , has read up on the <unk> conflict assiduously and wants to show the horrific consequences of war and give a voice to all sides involved .
in terms of content , however , she remained vague .
a second , considerably different <unk> of the film is being circulated on the internet . the <unk> had known each other before the outbreak of war and meet again when she , a bosnian muslim , is kidnapped to a serbian camp where he is working as a guard .
that sounds a very different story to the " rape victim falls for <unk> " scenario .
the fact that <unk> 's film actually begins before the war is clear .
according to <unk> , the pressure on her is " unfair and based on false information . "
now only the <unk> from <unk> can give her any peace by illegally <unk> the script on the web , as has been the fate of so many other <unk> .
let 's get out of here
this evening , everything is finally going well for the irish .
not a trace of <unk> .
the home team is <unk> its guests from sweden , finland and the usa too much for that .
the <unk> are <unk> for joy against a <unk> of <unk> music and stamping feet .
the <unk> pub in cork , southern ireland , is <unk> because the table <unk> players are throwing <unk> <unk> <unk> into beer glasses over a three metre distance - and <unk> .
" beer <unk> " is the name of the bizarre <unk> ; the winner gets 000 euros win bonus plus plane tickets to las vegas for the beer <unk> world <unk> in january .
<unk> <unk> is a quiet type ; this <unk> drinking game and the reticent computer scientist do not really go together .
but the 00 - year - old is trying to <unk> himself by playing , to <unk> from the burning question of what the future will bring .
he has not scheduled in a round of gambling in las vegas - he will be taking part in job <unk> in new zealand in january .
" i have a <unk> feeling doing it , " he says .
" it is so far from home and i still do n't have any work there . "
still , his <unk> is waiting for him in <unk> - " she got her dream job as event manager in no time - perhaps a good sign , " says the young man and smiles .
in response to the poor outlook at home , two of <unk> 's three <unk> are already taking their chances abroad .
his <unk> <unk> , a social worker , is in <unk> and his brother <unk> has got a job as an it consultant in london .
young people are leaving . <unk> 's family is hardly the exception for families on the island .
000,000 irish men and women will leave the country in the near future , predict experts from the economic and social research institute ( <unk> ) in dublin .
by 0000 , they estimate a total of 000,000 emigrants .
for a small country with only 0.0 million inhabitants , that will be a significant loss .
if the predictions prove to be correct , there will be a wave of emigration comparable to the emigration ireland suffered in the 00s .
after a decade of growth that brought great prosperity for the irish with it , the hard times have returned .
the economic crisis is particularly <unk> for young , well - educated irish who have only seen things getting better .
job losses and social descent seemed absurd in the boom years .
everyone was needed and there was money <unk> .
since then , three out of every ten men and women under thirty are without work .
in the irish times , there are many letters from young emigrants complaining that " everything is going down the pan in ireland . "
" there should be a revolution against the politicians and <unk> - but anyone who can simply leaves and our country is losing an entire generation . "
" can the last person please turn out the light . "
law student <unk> <unk> , president of the irish union of students , sees a dismal future ahead , because the government is engaged in window - <unk> and is no longer offering young people prospects for the future .
" they are reducing the minimum wage , but they do n't have a strategy to create new jobs , " says the 00 - year - old .
she sees her fellow students making their way from one unpaid <unk> to another .
her greatest concern is that she will have to emigrate in four years as well .
" the thought is sad and depressing . "
on the other hand , men such as <unk> <unk> try to give the situation a positive <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> , a fair offering an all - round service for work abroad .
" for people starting a career , working abroad is a great chance to take your first steps onto the career <unk> , " says the manager .
there are <unk> of surfers in australia and <unk> in canada on his website .
the message is clear . working abroad is not <unk> duty , but a source of freedom and fun .
for the last six months , <unk> <unk> has known what it feels like to build something somewhere else .
as there was nothing more for the 00 - year - old engineer in ireland , he is now working with 00 irish colleagues on building sites in germany .
they are currently working on a fashion <unk> in <unk> .
in january , they will move on to <unk> or berlin - to the next project .
in the meantime , <unk> visits his home country seldom , as he is taking on extra <unk> to be able to pay off the mortgage on his house at home .
" the situation is really a bit crazy , " he says , as he goes through the door of his house for the first time in a long time .
" i am earning money in germany for a house in ireland that i barely see . "
he <unk> a little self - consciously and <unk> through the cold rooms .
the small house is in a <unk> neighbourhood with tended front gardens . large , expensive cars are <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> bought the house with his <unk> four years ago for 000,000 euros - financed with a 000 percent mortgage .
" they were <unk> times - there was easy money without too many questions , " he says .
is he worried that things could go wrong with the mortgage ?
<unk> thinks for a while , pours some more <unk> and says : " i do n't have any children to feed and i am young . even if everything goes wrong , i can start again . "
the civil engineer does not like the <unk> that he <unk> so often .
" no one has to starve - out situation is nowhere near as dramatic as times this island has gone through in the past , " he says .
" working abroad for a while is not the worst that can happen - perhaps we only really feel irish by going abroad . "
he <unk> and recalls how his father went to england in the last great economic crisis .
" seven years later , he was back and life went on in ireland , just like that . "
<unk> <unk> likes that idea .
leave the future open and just see what it is like living somewhere else .
he has already spent a few years working in london and why should things not go well for him and his <unk> new zealand ?
one thing still worries him well and truly these days - the party for his 00th birthday on friday in dublin .
he worries it could degenerate into a farewell party .
" just not too much emotion , " he says and drinks a large <unk> of beer .
" farewell - that sounds alarming . "
" lets just call it a going away party , really relaxed with a few friends , a couple of drinks and the odd game . "
the democratic routine
support for democracy in latin america continues to edge up , as does backing for private enterprise .
crime has become a bigger worry than unemployment .
and brazil is seen as more influential than the united states across much of the region .
those are some of the findings of the latest <unk> poll taken in 00 countries and published exclusively by the economist .
because the poll has been taken regularly since 0000 , it <unk> changes in attitude across the region .
two related things stand out in the results of this year 's poll , taken in september and early october .
the first is latin america 's fairly <unk> mood .
the second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its core institutions .
support for democracy has risen noticeably in several countries on the pacific <unk> of south america ( see table 0 ) .
for example in peru , where economic growth has averaged 0 % a year since 0000 , support for democracy has risen from a low of 00 % in 0000 to 00 % this year .
it also rose in mexico , where the economy has recovered after suffering a big drop in output last year .
but only around half of respondents in mexico and brazil , the region 's two most populous countries , are convinced democrats , which drags down the regional average ( see <unk> 0 ) .
some 00 % of respondents across the region pronounced themselves satisfied with how their country 's democracy works in practice , the same figure as last year but a big increase on the 00 % in 0000 ( <unk> 0 ) .
some 00 % said they had confidence in their country 's congress and 00 % in their government , the same as last year in both cases but up sharply from 0000 ( 00 % and 00 % respectively ) .
a decade ago economic woes in latin america undermined support for democracy .
that it has held up during the world financial crisis is probably because many latin american countries suffered only a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery .
in addition , a stronger social safety net has helped to shield the poor .
( the united nations ' economic commission for latin america reported this week that the proportion of latin americans living in poverty rose only marginally in 0000 and has fallen again this year , to 00 % . )
but the mood varies widely from country to country ( see <unk> 0 ) .
brazil 's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president , <unk> <unk> lula da silva , is reflected in a widely shared sense of progress .
that is <unk> in mexico and central america , where the recession was more severe and violent crime has worsened .
for only the second time since the polls began , more respondents across latin america as a whole cite crime , rather than unemployment , as the most important problem facing their country ( see <unk> 0 ) .
some 00 % say that either they or a close relative have been victims of crime over the past year , but that is down from 00 % last year and is the lowest figure since 0000 .
a more robust economic performance is reflected in rising support for private enterprise and the market economy : some 00 % of respondents across the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development , up from 00 % in 0000 ( see <unk> 0 ) .
some 00 % agree that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed , up from 00 % last year .
interestingly , 00 % of respondents in venezuela hold that view ( and 00 % there back private enterprise ) even though their left - wing president , hugo chávez , is <unk> many private companies .
brazil is the country which exercises most leadership in the region , mentioned by 00 % of respondents ( up from 00 % last year ) , followed by the united states ( 0 % , unchanged from last year ) and venezuela ( 0 % , down from 00 % last year ) .
but the united states is seen as the most influential country by respondents in mexico and much of central america , whereas venezuela enjoys that distinction in ecuador , the <unk> republic and nicaragua .
a vote <unk>
nobody expected haiti 's general election on november 00th to be perfect .
but it was far worse than the outsiders who are trying to help the stricken country feared .
it <unk> <unk> ballot boxes and repeat voting , ballot <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> stations and intimidation .
<unk> stations opened hours late .
many <unk> , including lots displaced by january 's earthquake , <unk> around trying to find out where to vote .
some of them eventually gave up .
a dozen presidential candidates , including several presumed front - <unk> , cried fraud and called for the election 's annulment .
protests , some of them violent , <unk> across the country .
nevertheless , <unk> <unk> , the united nations ' top official in haiti , declared it " a fairly good election in many ways . "
observers from the organisation of american states and the caribbean community said cautiously that they did " not believe these irregularities , serious as they were , necessarily invalidated the process . "
in other words , the show goes on .
the electoral authority , which opponents claim is <unk> to <unk> <unk> , the <unk> outgoing president and his candidate , <unk> <unk> , is due to announce preliminary results on december 0th .
the expected run - off is scheduled for january .
all hope in the election is not lost .
the two leading opposition candidates , michel <unk> , a rap <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , a former first lady , have <unk> from their initial call for the vote to be declared invalid .
but there may be trouble if mr <unk> , who has little or no discernible support among voters , is declared by the electoral authority to have reached the run - off .
with a cholera epidemic <unk> , and more than <unk> earthquake <unk> still living in <unk> , there were fears that turnout would be low .
in the event , a lot of <unk> wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so by <unk> .
some 000,000 identity cards , required for voting , remained <unk> shortly before the election .
much is at stake .
aid donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an essential step in haiti 's reconstruction .
and so , it is clear , do <unk> themselves .
<unk> to the centre
in the weeks since she was suddenly <unk> , cristina <unk> , argentina 's president , has benefited from a wave of public sympathy that has boosted her approval rating by 00 points , to over 00 % , its highest level since she was elected in 0000 .
yet turning this into a successful campaign for a second term at an election next year may depend on whether or not the visibly grieving ms <unk> abandons the intransigence of her late husband , predecessor and political partner , <unk> kirchner .
and on that the signs are mixed .
mr kirchner , who continued to handle economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president , was in the habit of drawing up budgets which underestimated tax revenues , economic growth and inflation .
that allowed the first couple to spend the extra revenues at will .
on paper ms <unk> 's government lost its majority in congress last year .
but the opposition is divided , and it was thrown further into <unk> by mr kirchner 's death of a heart attack on october 00th .
some <unk> members of the ruling <unk> movement have rallied to ms <unk> .
but after chaotic sessions ( in which a parliamentarian <unk> another in the face , and others accused the government of <unk> ) , congress failed to approve the 0000 budget .
" i <unk> not going to argue , " said the president .
the 0000 budget will now apply next year , giving the president even more room to spend at will .
the economy is <unk> <unk> : it is likely to grow by up to 0 % this year .
the official inflation rate now stands at 00.0 % , but many private estimates - and trade - union wage demands - put the figure close to 00 % .
mr kirchner , who took office in 0000 when argentina was <unk> by economic collapse , made growth and poverty reduction , rather than controlling inflation , his priorities .
he refused to deal with the <unk> , <unk> the private sector and <unk> <unk> , the statistics agency , which proceeded to doctor official inflation statistics .
might ms <unk> now moderate these policies ?
she has called for talks between private business and union leaders .
and her officials are saying that they want to limit wage increases next year to 00 % .
the economy has been <unk> by high world prices for argentina 's farm exports .
but inflation has eroded the boost to growth provided by a big devaluation in 0000 .
that may be why ms <unk> is showing signs of wanting to restore argentina 's financial ties to the rest of the world .
earlier this year the government struck a deal with <unk> who had refused an earlier forced restructuring of debt on which argentina defaulted in 0000 .
now ms <unk> seems to be <unk> towards an agreement with creditor governments <unk> in the paris club , to which it owes some <unk> 0.0 billion .
the <unk> always insisted this could not involve oversight by the <unk> , as is customary .
but last month amado <unk> , the economy minister , announced that the fund will provide " technical assistance " to design a new national consumer - price index , which looks like a <unk> to cleaning up <unk> .
it is not clear whether ms <unk> wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term now that her husband is no longer at her side .
if she does , she needs to win the support of the middle class , much of which has tired of <unk> .
by the time <unk> return from their summer holidays in march , the wave of sympathy for her will have <unk> .
if she wants to win another election she will have to decide whether or not quietly to <unk> many of her husband 's policies .
half a cheer for china
<unk> 's voters are <unk> towards a kind of closer union with the mainland .
what does <unk> think of its big brother across the strait ?
more than 0. <unk> voters turned out on november 00th , 00 % of those eligible , to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts , in what is seen as a broad assessment of the president , <unk> <unk> - <unk> .
mr <unk> himself has become a <unk> for feelings about the mainland , having forged <unk> business links , including a partial free - trade pact , in the biggest <unk> of relations with china proper since 0000 .
mr <unk> passed the test , but only just .
although his <unk> party ( <unk> ) ended up winning three of the five <unk> , it failed to win a majority of the votes .
instead , the democratic progressive party ( <unk> ) , which has <unk> towards <unk> independence for <unk> , won nearly 00 % of all votes to the <unk> 's 00 % .
had this been a presidential poll , mr <unk> would be in trouble .
since he was elected two years ago his party 's share of the vote has fallen by perhaps 0 % .
for the first time , the <unk> drew even with the <unk> in the city councils .
the election saw most of the <unk> of <unk> elections , including <unk> campaign trucks and flag - <unk> mass <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> girls .
it even saw the obligatory mysterious assassination attempt .
sean <unk> , son of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> 's <unk> chairman , was <unk> for a <unk> candidate on the eve of the election .
a man from the <unk> shot the young mr <unk> clean through the face , <unk> him and killing a bystander .
bizarrely , it has not been determined whether the <unk> intended to harm mr <unk> or to settle a dispute with the candidate .
either way , says <unk> <unk> - <unk> , the leader of the <unk> , the shooting affected the election , <unk> suspicion on the <unk> and driving voters towards the <unk> .
perhaps the only big winner from the campaign was china .
it was striking how the issue of the mainland itself was absent .
instead candidates <unk> over plans for public housing and job creation .
<unk> usually enjoys its de facto independence and <unk> china 's military threat .
so , the <unk> tends to avoid <unk> its ties to the government in beijing .
but this time the <unk> also refrained from <unk> up anti - china sentiment .
it is responding to a new awareness that chinese business is essential to <unk> 's economic survival .
mr <unk> , for his part , claimed confirmation that his china policy is acceptable to the <unk> majority .
the government in beijing can be expected to continue supplying commercial <unk> , in line with its strategy for <unk> <unk> back to the fold .
china wasted no time sending a negotiator to <unk> to arrange for a summit on investment protection and medical co - operation .
certainly , it would like to see political integration too , but first things first .
better to wait till after the 0000 presidential election for that .
the <unk> has anyway <unk> itself .
two years ago it was at a low point : its former leader , <unk> <unk> - <unk> , had been sent to jail on charges of corruption .
president in <unk> , he was a <unk> for explicit independence .
but under the leadership of ms <unk> , a new generation of <unk> has emerged and the <unk> is working hard to attract professionals and <unk> .
ms <unk> has been <unk> as a <unk> candidate for the presidency , as has <unk> <unk> - <unk> , who served under mr <unk> .
their party is now doing its best to show that it too can engage with beijing .
ms <unk> announced plans for a think - <unk> to act as a point of contact between the <unk> and china , provided their talks can be held without preconditions .
ms <unk> tells the <unk> public that her party presents a " trustworthy alternative " to mr <unk> 's hasty approach to china .
mr <unk> seems <unk> by the shift .
in a statement issued from his <unk> he said that the <unk> 's candidates would have fared better if they had insisted that <unk> is a separate country .
he even ordered mr <unk> , a <unk> , not to run for the presidency .
even without mr <unk> 's interference , the <unk> will struggle to choose between its potential candidates .
the <unk> is due for soul - searching of its own .
mr <unk> 's ratings have been poor , despite <unk> economic growth ; <unk> candidates have not wanted to campaign with him .
his <unk> seems to be owing largely to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor .
a <unk> spokesman says it will <unk> its cabinet as well as its local branches .
the <unk> 's strong showing suggests that <unk> 's support for rapprochement is limited .
at the same time most <unk> see the economic integration with china as inevitable .
according to antonio <unk> , a prominent <unk> , " the point of no return has already passed . "
<unk> nominations : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a surprise pick in best new artist category
perform at the request of a president , and people are bound to take notice .
<unk> <unk> , the 00 - year - old <unk> <unk> and <unk> hand - picked by president <unk> to perform at his nobel peace prize ceremony in 0000 , marked one of the <unk> ' surprises this year with a high - profile nomination in the best new artist category .
considering that <unk> has been a celebrated figure on the <unk> scene since her 0000 <unk> , " <unk> , " the nomination is a bit of a head - <unk> , but it is consistent with the <unk> ' rules of an artist not releasing more than three <unk> before the recording that " establishes the public identity of that artist . "
her ambitious 0000 <unk> , " chamber music society , " certainly marked a step forward , and given her <unk> inviting <unk> style and a <unk> hand with <unk> , <unk> and latin influences , it 's possible to draw at least a <unk> line to <unk> from <unk> <unk> ' <unk> success in 0000 , the closest equivalent to <unk> voters looking toward <unk> 's <unk> in this category in recent years .
elsewhere <unk> voters rightly <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> 's " <unk> " in the instrumental <unk> category , an <unk> <unk> - ride of a record that was a critical <unk> last year .
among those <unk> will be competing against include <unk> <unk> james <unk> 's " <unk> 0b " and <unk> john <unk> 's " <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> , a <unk> new <unk> <unk> and frequent guest on <unk> 's " <unk> , " was <unk> in the contemporary <unk> category , which otherwise <unk> heavily toward fusion with <unk> toward <unk> by <unk> <unk> , john <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
the wild , <unk> - informed <unk> james argue 's secret society earned some well - deserved recognition in the large <unk> category , competing against the <unk> <unk> <unk> 's rich chamber - <unk> and the ever - adventurous <unk> holland , whose <unk> 's live <unk> " pathways " was a fine example of the <unk> 's democratic hand as a <unk> .

<unk> - tolerant <unk> raises possibility of new types of life on earth , or elsewhere
the discovery of a strange <unk> that can use <unk> as one of its nutrients <unk> the scope for finding new forms of life on earth and possibly beyond .
while researchers discovered the unusual <unk> here on earth , they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential .
" this organism has dual capability . "
" it can grow with either <unk> or <unk> . "
" that makes it very peculiar , though it falls short of being some form of truly ' <unk> ' life , " <unk> paul c. <unk> davies of <unk> state university , a co - author of the report appearing in thursday 's online edition of the journal science .
six major elements have long been considered essential for life - carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and <unk> .
but the researchers found that the <unk> , discovered in <unk> lake , <unk> , is able to continue to grow after substituting <unk> for <unk> .
" it makes you wonder what else is possible , " said <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> state university , a co - author of the report .
the find is important in the search for life beyond earth because researchers need to be able to <unk> life , to know what life looks like , <unk> said .
the study focuses on a <unk> found on earth .
however , the announcement of a news conference to discuss it , which did not disclose details of the find , generated widespread speculation on the internet that the report would disclose the discovery of <unk> life .
it did n't .
the discovery " does show that in other <unk> environments organisms might be able to use other elements to drive <unk> and that the ' standard ' set of elements we think are absolutely necessary for life might not be so fixed , " <unk> charles <unk> , professor at the <unk> and space sciences research institute , open university , in <unk> <unk> , united kingdom .
<unk> was not part of the research team .
" this work is novel because it shows the substitution of one element for another in fundamental <unk> and <unk> structure , " added <unk> .
it was n't a chance discovery .
<unk> <unk> - <unk> of nasa 's <unk> institute , who led the study , targeted <unk> lake because it has high <unk> levels .
<unk> and <unk> are <unk> similar , so she <unk> that a <unk> exposed to both might be able to substitute one for the other .
" <unk> is toxic mainly because its chemical <unk> is so similar to that of phosphorus . "
" as a result , organisms have a hard time telling these elements apart . "
" but <unk> is different enough that it does n't work as well as phosphorus , so it gets in there and sort of <unk> up the works of our <unk> machinery , " explained <unk> .
the researchers collected the <unk> known as <unk> - 0 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of <unk> , which it was able to adapt to and grow .
the <unk> does grow better on <unk> , but showing that it can live with <unk> instead raises the possibility that a life form using <unk> could occur naturally , either elsewhere on earth or on another planet or moon where <unk> is more common .
<unk> <unk> foster , an assistant professor of <unk> at the university of <unk> , said the idea that <unk> could be substituted for <unk> is n't new , but there has never been example where it was shown to work .
<unk> was more common in the early times on earth , she said , so researchers have <unk> that early life forms might have used it .
" it does suggest that that there could be other ways to form life , not just how life formed on early earth , " said foster , who was not part of <unk> - <unk> 's research team .
the research was supported by nasa , the department of energy and the national institutes of health .
remaining stolen show dogs found in <unk>

" they are in good condition . "
" they have been returned to their rightful owners . "
<unk> declined to say precisely where the dogs were found , in what <unk> , and the circumstances surrounding their discovery .
" there is an investigation going on . "
" we do n't want to say , " <unk> said .
" we are following leads . "
the dogs owners , <unk> <unk> and david <unk> , could not be reached for comment thursday .
they were reunited with their two <unk> at a county - run animal shelter in <unk> on wednesday afternoon .
<unk> 's <unk> found the van and the two dogs separately in <unk> .
the <unk> - trace , a 0 - year - old male , and <unk> , a 00 - month - old female - were <unk> , authorities said .
but <unk> and peter , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> planned to show at area competitions this week on behalf of the dogs ' japanese owners , remained missing until their discovering late wednesday .

the other dogs were expected to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days before the <unk> / <unk> show , <unk> told the times on wednesday .
southern california is one stop on the couple 's nearly month - long tour of dog shows .
on monday night , <unk> and <unk> checked into the <unk> .
they often stay in <unk> and park their van right outside their room window .

it was unclear thursday whether an award would be given .
lion ready to <unk> again as <unk> restructuring gets final court go - ahead
after 00 months of turmoil and uncertainty , <unk> has finally <unk> a green light to start <unk> .
a new york federal bankruptcy judge on thursday officially <unk> the " pre - <unk> " plan by creditors to wipe out about <unk> 0 billion in debt , clearing the way for the 00 - year - old <unk> company to focus its efforts on producing and releasing <unk> and television shows .
with thursday 's ruling that the plan meets the requirements of the <unk> bankruptcy code , no more legal obstacles remain for <unk> to relaunch under <unk> <unk> founders <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , who will become chief executives of what will be a <unk> - down <unk> .
the staff will drop to about 000 from over 000 .
<unk> will not actually emerge from chapter 00 until <unk> chase closes a planned <unk> 000 - million loan facility to fund the new <unk> 's operations and <unk> .
it is currently being <unk> by the investment bank - which is itself <unk> in <unk> 00 million - and is expected to be funded by mid - december .
the <unk> 's restructuring process began in may 0000 , when investment bank <unk> & <unk> was <unk> to advise management on how to fix its finances as it was struggling to afford interest payments of <unk> 000 million per year .
that august , chief executive <unk> <unk> was replaced by <unk> <unk> , a former ceo of <unk> and a turnaround expert known for his work at <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ' and <unk> 's attempts to resolve <unk> 's financial woes and satisfy the <unk> 's 000 - plus creditors took much longer than expected .
after several months of discussions , the parties agreed in late 0000 to put the company up for sale .
however , the auction attracted few <unk> and none willing to pay the <unk> 0 billion - plus that creditors were seeking .
by the spring of this year , it was back to the drawing board as the <unk> team began working on a restructuring plan that , after months of debate and internal <unk> , was finally endorsed by creditors in late october .
when <unk> officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks , <unk> and <unk> 's firms will receive <unk> - dollar bonuses for their work .
<unk> & <unk> , which has already received <unk> 0.0 million , will get a <unk> 0.0 - million payment .
<unk> 's firms , which have been collecting <unk> 000,000 per month for their services running the company , will receive a <unk> 0 - million " success <unk> . "
<unk> and <unk> plan to <unk> production at <unk> , which released only one <unk> this year , and put together an annual <unk> of seven or eight films that will come out starting in 0000 .
they also plan to co - finance two <unk> based on " the <unk> , " along with <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> needs to close a separate loan of between <unk> 000 million and <unk> 000 million to fund its portion of those two <unk> , which are to be directed by peter <unk> .
investor carl <unk> , who owns about 00 % of <unk> 's debt , had been seeking to arrange a merger of the <unk> with <unk> gate <unk> , in which he is the largest shareholder .
however , recent talks between the two companies have not resulted in a deal .
tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
while the leading candidate for this year 's most <unk> toy is the <unk> , followed by , perhaps , a microsoft <unk> video game system , both can put a significant <unk> in your gift budget .
consider that for the price of one <unk> , you can buy five <unk> 00 <unk> bicycles , and that one <unk> game costs the same as 00 classic <unk> jump <unk> , or about 00 <unk> of play - <unk> .
but there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance .
i recently visited three national toy <unk> - a <unk> - <unk> , a toys " <unk> " us and a <unk> 's wholesale club - to see what electronic toys i could buy for less than <unk> 00 .
it was immediately clear that <unk> 's law has been at work ; this year 's technology toy is likely to have more power , while costing the same if not a bit less compared with last year 's .
in addition , while there are generally fewer new toys with associated web sites , two of the most well known of this type , <unk> and club <unk> , have more offerings .
and button - <unk> <unk> toys are increasing , as well as toys with <unk> batteries .
here are some recommendations .
( all prices are from toys " <unk> " us , except if otherwise noted . )
sing - a - <unk> - <unk> ( mattel , <unk> 00 , for ages 0 and up ) are guinea pig - sized <unk> toys that sing a note when you squeeze their <unk> .
one squeeze equals one note , and a second squeeze starts building a song .
if you buy more than one , they 'll sing in harmony .
caution : once you start <unk> , you ca n't stop .
for singing combined with <unk> , dance star <unk> ( fisher - price , <unk> 00 , for ages 0 and up ) is the best choice .
borrowing on last year 's <unk> live technology , the 00 - inch <unk> <unk> plays turn - taking games like <unk> says , and can moon walk , thanks to his innovative <unk> feet with <unk> <unk> .
children testing the toy used <unk> as a dance <unk> although their parents complained about the lack of a volume control .
if you <unk> a child of the '00s , you may recall <unk> , one of the first <unk> educational toys .
he 's back , ( <unk> / <unk> , <unk> 00 , for ages 0 and up ) , with a <unk> full of <unk> cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self - correcting , <unk> <unk> .
if you <unk> <unk> of handing your child your <unk> , here are three stand - alone alternatives .
<unk> 's <unk> ( <unk> 00 , for ages 0 to 0 ) is the cheapest and easiest to use , featuring a <unk> <unk> , although the games do n't teach as effectively as the <unk> <unk> ( <unk> 00 , for ages 0 to 00 ) , <unk> 's first major overhaul of the <unk> line , with a newer , <unk> screen .
neither version is compatible with older <unk> .
fisher - price 's <unk> ( <unk> 00 , for ages 0 to 0 ) uses an <unk> - like system to deliver games and <unk> , and has an <unk> card <unk> that makes it possible to display family <unk> .
finally , <unk> flash ( <unk> 00 , <unk> , for ages 0 and up ) is a set of five blocks just larger than a book of <unk> , each with its own led screen .
the goal is to make words by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out ; it 's great for an <unk> <unk> <unk> .
increasingly , toys have some sort of online connection .
based on their presence in toy stores alone , the two largest are <unk> and club <unk> .
to buy your child an online <unk> in club <unk> , for example , you can get a <unk> club <unk> 0 " mix ' n match figure pack , <unk> 0 , for ages 0 to 00 ) that includes a coin with a hidden code .

bringing a softer side to policing in china
like an urban <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> on a city square , <unk> inspecting his nervous charges , issuing <unk> <unk> commands with military authority .
he wanted the female members of <unk> - china 's <unk> <unk> of urban order , feared and despised for their <unk> <unk> and <unk> for violence - to convey a certain impression to a <unk> of <unk> .
" stand straight ! "
" look sharp ! "
show them , he <unk> , " what pretty girls are like ! "
four barely - past - teenage girls in white <unk> and identical olive <unk> and <unk> snapped to attention .
four <unk> of black pumps <unk> up <unk> - straight .
four <unk> <unk> <unk> perfectly <unk> hair bound in blue and white <unk> <unk> .
" personally , i think they are average - looking , " mr. <unk> said , dismissively .
" models are pretty . "
more than one government has tried to <unk> up the image of china 's urban <unk> .
one city mandated that all new recruits have a college degree .
<unk> province changed the <unk> - green <unk> to a supposedly more inviting blue .
<unk> , in central china , substituted <unk> - downs for strong - <unk> : in 0000 , one report stated , 00 officers <unk> a <unk> <unk> cart , <unk> steadily for a half hour until the <unk> packed up and left .
<unk> , an urban <unk> of 000,000 in <unk> , has chosen major image <unk> .
since 0000 , the <unk> has supplemented its urban street police with 00 women , specifically chosen for their looks , <unk> and youth .
the idea is to give the rough - <unk> police a softer , feminine side .
unfortunately , even <unk> <unk> might struggle to raise china 's <unk> regard for these city squads .
and for good reason , critics would argue .
unlike the police , these officers are <unk> only to enforce city <unk> by imposing fines and other administrative penalties .
but the chinese news media routinely <unk> a different reality .
in january 0000 , <unk> province <unk> beat a bystander to death after he used his <unk> to film them breaking up a protest against a waste dump .
last year , a training manual for beijing <unk> , <unk> and posted online , described how to effectively <unk> offenders without drawing blood .
this year , a <unk> <unk> <unk> was left brain - damaged after a <unk> with five officers .
one violence - <unk> video game , available for <unk> online , features chinese - trained <unk> who <unk> street <unk> .
" <unk> has <unk> the government , " china daily , a national publication , lamented last year after yet another controversy over tactics .
the paper demanded a " truly thorough clean - up . "
<unk> say the approach here falls far short of that .
after the <unk> advertised for eight new female recruits in october , an editorial in the beijing evening news questioned whether the women had actual duties or were simply <unk> <unk> .
the answer appears to be a little of both .
the <unk> 's <unk> called for female applicants 00 to 00 years old , with a good figure and " the five facial features in proper order . "
they should be above - average height - <unk> than 0.0 <unk> or 0 feet , 0 <unk> <unk> .
retirement at age 00 is mandatory .
officials said the job was physically too arduous for women over 00 .
" their image is the important thing , " one <unk> <unk> official told <unk> , a quasi - governmental web site .
" first , the candidates ' external qualities will determine if they make the cut , such as height , weight , facial features , etc. "
next comes <unk> and " inner qualities . "
female <unk> are like <unk> <unk> , he said , adding , " besides being <unk> , they will have other responsibilities . "
<unk> <unk> , the deputy director of the <unk> 's city management bureau , is not eager to endorse that description .
but he noted that height requirements were standard in many chinese job <unk> for both sexes .
so is the demand for orderly facial features .
whether that means good - looking is a matter of debate among chinese .
certainly , the disabled or <unk> need not apply .
" we ca n't let a <unk> person or a <unk> come to serve here , " mr. <unk> said .
" his image would not be good . "
<unk> <unk> , who patrols the <unk> square near a <unk> , is 00 , apple - <unk> with a finely <unk> mouth .
she does not consider the stress on her appearance to be <unk> , she said .
" do you think i look sexy in this uniform ? " she asked with a <unk> look .
said her <unk> co - worker , 00 - year - old <unk> <unk> , " our job is to present the city 's image . "
they do not object to their limited tenure either , they said , because they <unk> career ambitions greater than simply <unk> <unk> into the <unk> where they are supposed to confine their business .
every morning , the squad faces off against a dozen or so <unk> who <unk> around on foot or bicycle , trying to sell as many <unk> or <unk> of <unk> as possible before they are run off .
" master wang , you have to leave . "
" we have told you many times ! " said <unk> <unk> as one <unk> fled on foot , temporarily <unk> his bicycle - drawn cart of <unk> - <unk> .
the officers describe their duties as more <unk> than strenuous .
" it is pretty much the same every day , " said <unk> <unk> , 00 , who studies marketing in her off hours .
" very routine . "
one reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate <unk> ' goods .
they can only threaten to report <unk> to their male supervisors .
that tends to shield them from the sudden public <unk> of animosity against <unk> that are common throughout china .
this year hundreds of citizens in <unk> , the <unk> provincial capital , <unk> after false <unk> spread that <unk> officers had killed a <unk> .
more than a dozen police or <unk> officers were injured in the <unk> episode ; 00 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire .
<unk> has so far escaped such violence .
but calm is hardly guaranteed .
just two blocks from <unk> <unk> square , where the female officers <unk> that morning , more than 00 people gathered on a street corner .
officers had confiscated a <unk> that was being repaired on the <unk> instead of inside a shop , as regulations require .
the <unk> 's <unk> was crying <unk> .
a 00 - minute <unk> ensued before the officers , grim - faced , <unk> their way to their vehicles and <unk> off with the <unk> and its <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , 00 , a coordinator attached to the male squad , remained behind , his white badge <unk> over to conceal his name .
like the female officers , the coordinators - men age 00 or over - play a purely supportive role .
unlike them , they are not schooled in maintaining a <unk> image .
" sometimes we fight verbally . "
" sometimes we fight physically , " mr. <unk> said matter - of - <unk> .
" most of the time it is the public who starts it . "
prosecutors wo n't charge <unk> <unk>
justice department prosecutors have cleared <unk> john <unk> of criminal allegations arising from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the woman 's husband , the <unk> 's lawyers announced wednesday .
the decision ends the most serious legal threat facing mr. <unk> , the <unk> republican who was considered a possible republican presidential candidate in 0000 until the scandal over his affair made national headlines last year and damaged his career .
mr. <unk> 's office said he was " certainly pleased " by the decision , which followed a <unk> investigation .
the <unk> could still face <unk> action by the senate ethics committee .
mr. <unk> 's lawyers said the justice department had " informed us that <unk> <unk> is no longer a target of its investigation and that it has no plans to bring any charges against him in this matter . "
the justice department declined to comment on the case .
the announcement came as something of a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the justice department , who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that mr. <unk> may have <unk> to violate a criminal ban on federal lobbying .
<unk> , e-mail and other documents first disclosed in october 0000 in the new york times indicated that mr. <unk> had helped <unk> hampton , who was one of his <unk> , secure lucrative lobbying work to win the silence of mr. hampton and his wife , <unk> , about the <unk> 's affair with her .
mrs. hampton once served as <unk> of an <unk> campaign .
mr. <unk> contacted a number of political <unk> to find work for mr. hampton and then advocated on their behalf after they had <unk> mr. hampton to lobby for them , according to the documents and <unk> .
because mr. hampton had recently been an aide to mr. <unk> , he was <unk> by law from lobbying his former employer or the senate as a whole for a year .
ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between mr. <unk> and mr. hampton , who were close friends before the affair , appeared at odds with the so - called revolving door lobbying ban .
from the evidence that has been made public , " there appeared to be a <unk> <unk> case of a conspiracy to violate , and substantial violation of the revolving door statute , " said <unk> brand , a washington lawyer who <unk> in defending clients investigated by the government .
while justice department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the <unk> case , mr. brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared wary of taking on political <unk> after a number of high - profile setbacks for its public integrity section , including the decision last year to drop the prosecution against former <unk> <unk> <unk> amid charges of <unk> <unk> .
federal prosecutors " are clearly <unk> shy , " said <unk> <unk> , the executive director of citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington , an advocacy group that brought several complaints against mr. <unk> in the case .
" this basically says high - ranking government officials can now assume the laws do n't apply to them , " she added .
paul <unk> , mr. <unk> 's lead lawyer , said in an interview that he received a phone call from a justice department prosecutor on monday and a follow - up the next day , telling him that the department was not seeking charges against his client .
mr. <unk> 's <unk> team had been cooperating with prosecutors in trying to persuade them that the <unk> , as his office reiterated in a statement wednesday , " acted in accordance with the law . "
mr. <unk> declined to spell out the legal arguments he made to prosecutors .
" i <unk> not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the justice department except to say that we think they made the right decision , " he said .
last month , the federal election commission decided to drop an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group <unk> that a <unk> 00,000 payment from mr. <unk> 's parents to the <unk> violated federal election law .
the election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove the money was anything except a gift .
one company for which mr. <unk> helped mr. hampton find lobbying work was <unk> energy , a major <unk> company that had long supported the <unk> .
one e-mail sent in december 0000 showed that after the company brought mr. hampton on as a lobbyist , mr. <unk> 's chief of staff , john <unk> , communicated with mr. hampton and told him that he was " <unk> " the interior department over an issue in dispute .
mr. <unk> also attended a <unk> with mr. hampton and another <unk> client , <unk> air , and called the transportation secretary to set up a meeting on the airline 's behalf after it had <unk> mr. hampton to do lobbying work .
when news of the affair first <unk> last year , mr. <unk> <unk> to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth - ranking republican leader in the senate .
after keeping a low profile for many months , mr. <unk> told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to run for a third term in the senate .
in announcing that mr. <unk> was no longer the target of a criminal investigation , his <unk> , <unk> <unk> , said the <unk> hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the justice department 's lead and end its inquiry .
" <unk> <unk> looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of <unk> , " she said .
<unk> appeal will point to <unk>
there were half a dozen of them <unk> away in the <unk> <unk> .
minute by minute , they sent out reports of gruesome testimony via <unk> .
in the end , the <unk> says , there were more than 000,000 <unk> messages about the trial that dealt with rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set <unk> .
on thursday , the widely followed trial of <unk> <unk> <unk> , who was convicted of killing three members of a <unk> , <unk> , family , is set to come to an official end with the judge 's imposition of the death sentence voted for by the jury .
but lawyers for mr. <unk> have already made court <unk> that <unk> out appeals arguments that are likely to occupy the courts for years .
one of the most provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - including mainstream reporters ' extensive use of <unk> - created a " circus atmosphere " and such widespread , instant saturation with <unk> details that the jury was improperly swayed by public <unk> .
the claim could force appeals judges to grapple with the question of whether new technology requires new <unk> rules .
" as i experienced it during this trial , i think there 's a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the <unk> is affecting an individual 's fair - trial rights , " said <unk> <unk> <unk> , mr. <unk> 's chief <unk> lawyer .
the trial judge , <unk> c. blue of state superior court , <unk> rejected the claims in a ruling last week , saying that the news media were " carefully controlled " and that there was no evidence the jury was driven by passion .
but that is not likely to be the last word on the issue .
for decades , appeals courts have recognized that coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about a trial 's fairness .
in a landmark 0000 ruling , the united states supreme court overturned the conviction of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , for the murder of his wife , saying in its decision , <unk> <unk> <unk> , that there was a " <unk> atmosphere at trial " because of the news media .
the crime is believed by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the <unk> " the fugitive . "
some lawyers said appeals courts reviewing mr. <unk> 's conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules could be necessary to govern ways of communicating from <unk> unimagined at the time of <unk> <unk> 's case .
" there is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media " in high - profile trials , said john <unk> <unk> iii , a <unk> law school professor who studied the <unk> death penalty and wrote a report that said it was arbitrarily enforced .
professor <unk> said some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from <unk> might make trials fairer .
the <unk> issue is just one of many outlined by mr. <unk> 's lawyers that are likely to be argued for years , delaying an execution .
the <unk> lawyers also claim , for example , that mr. <unk> may have been prejudiced when judge blue declined to allow them to test potential <unk> ' reactions by showing them <unk> crime - scene photographs during jury selection .
some of the <unk> have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims , <unk> <unk> - <unk> , 00 , and her daughters , <unk> , 00 , and <unk> , 00 .
the <unk> lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wrongly removed a <unk> who had been critical of prosecutors and that he improperly added pressure for a verdict by his unusual decision to direct the jury to deliberate over a weekend .
the <unk> were not <unk> .
but their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the trial may draw the most interest .
they noted in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in <unk> and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for <unk> and the united states senate .
they argued that the news media continually <unk> the flames of emotion about the case .
" the daily crush of media <unk> , cameras and reporters outside the <unk> , " the lawyers wrote , " was unlike anything ever seen here in new <unk> and maybe <unk> . "
their focus on the <unk> coverage is controversial .
in <unk> , some journalists said the claim that instant news was more <unk> than reports delivered more slowly was a <unk> view that would make poor court policy governing coverage of future trials .
but some lawyers said appeals courts were often attracted to arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts .
mr. <unk> 's lawyers are pressing that claim .
in their filing , they referred to the supreme court 's 0000 decision <unk> <unk> <unk> 's conviction because of the trial coverage and made it clear they would claim that the new media required new rules .
" this case , " they wrote , " represents the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the 00st century . "
can <unk> bridge the divide ?
after a campaign notable for invective and negativity , a modicum of <unk> has broken out in washington this week .
is it a <unk> of genuine <unk> cooperation ahead or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital ?
tuesday 's meeting between president <unk> and <unk> leaders produced no breakthroughs on the big issues that must be dealt with during the <unk> - <unk> session .
but by all accounts , it was at least a polite discussion of the two sides ' differences as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern , rather than another empty episode of partisan point <unk> .
wednesday 's public meeting of the president 's deficit commission was equally <unk> , despite the policy differences that remain among the members .
it seems clear that close interaction over a period of months produced a mutual respect that <unk> the ideological gulf that still separates the members .
that 's hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived .
both sides are now in a period of testing - <unk> one another for signs of <unk> and compromise while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and voters ' patience for renewed partisan <unk> .
which is why the meeting on tuesday and the participants ' reviews of it <unk> were done with a minimum of demands or accusations .
the <unk> differences between <unk> and the <unk> are too large and too deeply held to suggest any quick change in the climate that existed during the past two years .
whether the issue is taxes , spending , health care or entitlements , the two sides remain miles apart .
still , the november election has tempered washington , at least in the short term .
" there 's no question that <unk> things have changed , " said <unk> <unk> , a bush administration official now with the ethics and public policy <unk> .
" those are inevitable after elections .
elections arouse partisan <unk> , and then they die down .
that is good . "
on some issues , particularly those on the agenda for the <unk> - <unk> session , <unk> and democrats have little choice but to find a solution .
the bush tax cuts expire at the end of the year , and nobody <unk> that .
both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of them , permanently or temporarily .
similarly , compromise is likely on extending unemployment benefits , if only because <unk> ca n't afford to look like they <unk> tax cuts for the wealthy while denying jobless workers unemployment compensation .
after tuesday 's meeting at the white house , there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the <unk> <unk> session , along with ratification of the new start pact .
but <unk> <unk> of the <unk> institution <unk> that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the <unk> - <unk> session will not necessarily lead to continued <unk> when the new 000th congress <unk> in january .
instead , he said , a period of disagreement is likely , even inevitable .
" after things that have to get done get done , the psychology in the short term will revert to one of confrontation , " he said .
<unk> , too , expressed <unk> - which is widely shared - that <unk> will lead to real cooperation .
" i view most of what happens between now and 0000 as an <unk> , or shadow <unk> , to the main event in 0000 , " he said .
the reasons have much to do with the <unk> of the new republican majority in the house and the <unk> party voters who were instrumental in creating it .
however mindful republican leaders are of the dangers of <unk> their hand , they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut government spending and repeal the new health - care law .
those partisan lines are already clear in the initial reactions to the deficit commission recommendations , which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes , raising the retirement age and cutting spending .
co - chairs alan simpson and <unk> bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in washington and have , in their own estimation , forced the issue of the deficit onto the public agenda in ways that ca n't be ignored .
but they need 00 votes on the 00 - member commission to issue their plan as an official recommendation , and they have been struggling to get anywhere close to that number .
the greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel , suggesting that on fiscal issues there is , today at least , little grounds for or desire for compromise .
<unk> predicts two phases in the battles between the white house and <unk> <unk> .
the first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes , as <unk> challenge <unk> on the budget , taxes and health care , followed later by a period of greater <unk> cooperation .
what would cause the shift ?
public opinion .
there is considerable evidence that , despite the <unk> of the recent election , a majority of americans still want to see the two parties work together .
if confrontation leads to stalemate , as it did in 0000 , then both parties will be carefully watching the public reaction .
whoever is judged to be losing is likely to shift course and seek compromise .
that , however , may be an optimistic view .
<unk> and <unk> are greater today than they were in the mid - 0000s , and there appears to be a bigger ideological gap between <unk> and <unk> <unk> than there was between president bill clinton and the <unk> then .
at the same time , activists in both parties see 0000 as mere <unk> to a more <unk> election in 0000 .
given that reality , the <unk> on display this week may be welcomed by many americans .
but it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them .
leaked <unk> document <unk> moscow as <unk> of corruption
control of the city is in the hands of a " <unk> , " and it passes on a portion of the <unk> and protection money it collects all the way to the kremlin , the <unk> <unk> in russia reported in a memo in february .
both the police and the federal security service run huge protection <unk> that help account for the high cost of living in moscow , it said .
they collect money not only from legitimate businesses but from <unk> criminal groups as well .
each layer of the bureaucracy - what prime minister vladimir putin has termed the " vertical of authority " - takes its cut as the money moves up the <unk> .
the memo , which was sent to washington under the name of ambassador john <unk> , was posted by <unk> on its web site wednesday .
the memo is based on sources whose names have been <unk> .
it was written while <unk> <unk> was still moscow 's mayor , and it blames him for much of the corruption .
he was fired in october by president <unk> <unk> , but there has been little evidence of a <unk> since then .
<unk> and his wife , <unk> <unk> , who owns a prominent construction firm , have consistently denied corruption accusations over the years , and he has won several <unk> suits over such accusations .
in september he told a russian television station , when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt : " it is <unk> , it is <unk> , it is a mess . "
russians overwhelmingly believe that theirs is a corrupt society , polls have shown .
but it is unusual to find the <unk> spelled out as they were in the <unk> 's report , and it is unheard of that it should be diplomats from a foreign country doing so .
" the moscow city government 's direct links to criminality have led some to call it ' dysfunctional , ' and to assert that the government operates more as a <unk> than a government , " the memo says .
" criminal elements enjoy a ' <unk> ' ( a term from the criminal / mafia world literally meaning ' <unk> ' or protection ) that runs through the police , the federal security service ( fsb ) , ministry of internal affairs ( <unk> ) , and the prosecutor 's office , as well as throughout the moscow city government bureaucracy .
" analysts identify a three - <unk> structure in moscow 's criminal world . "
" <unk> is at the top . "
" the fsb , <unk> and militia are at the second level . "
" finally , ordinary criminals and corrupt <unk> are at the lowest level . "
" this is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas because the city is not providing some services . "
the report says that the fsb <unk> in money from the biggest firms , and that the police target small businesses .
one source , it said , " explained that moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the <unk> and fsb ( rather than <unk> crime groups ) since they not only have more guns , resources , and power than criminal groups , but they are also protected by the law . "
" for this reason , protection from criminal gangs is no longer so high in demand . "
the memo notes that , while the collection of money is comprehensive , the protection itself can be <unk> ; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest .
those who do not pay quickly find their businesses shut down on one pretext or another .
<unk> has talked several times about fighting corruption but has admitted that he has made little headway .
the <unk> memo <unk> reports of men taking suitcases , presumably <unk> with cash , into the kremlin itself .
" in his fight against corruption , <unk> has to rely on bureaucrats , " <unk> <unk> , director of the moscow think <unk> <unk> , said in a recent interview .
" but he is a part of this bureaucracy . "
" he is not part of a political class , because a political class does n't exist in russia anymore . "
without politics , without an opposition , without a separation of powers , he said , corruption is inevitable .
<unk> , <unk> estimates that corruption costs russia more than <unk> 000 billion a year .
the country was ranked 000th in a recent survey on global <unk> of corruption by the nongovernmental organization transparency international ( countries are ranked from least to most corrupt ) .
the disclosure of the <unk> <unk> memo , which did n't occur until late evening moscow time , is sure to stir displeasure within the russian government , although to the extent that <unk> can be blamed for moscow 's failings , it might be an opportunity for the kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem .
interviewed for <unk> by <unk> king , putin suggested that the <unk> documents may be <unk> and reacted <unk> to a disclosure that <unk> diplomats had called him <unk> to <unk> 's <unk> .
" the truth of the matter is , this is about our interaction , which is an important factor of the domestic policies in this country , " he said .
" but to be honest with you , we did n't suspect that this would be done with such arrogance , with such a push and , you know , being so <unk> done . "
<unk> <unk> <unk> forced to confront the past
in a <unk> <unk> concrete <unk> with <unk> and <unk> walls , the principal of <unk> <unk> high school recalled the man who had built it , the late <unk> <unk> leader <unk> <unk> .
" everyone here <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
" he was a good leader , and he cared about his people , " said <unk> <unk> <unk> , 00 .
known as " the <unk> " for his brutality during <unk> <unk> rule , the commander remains popular in this remote former <unk> <unk> <unk> in northwestern cambodia , where he built hospitals , bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of the organization 's former soldiers still live .
but this year , 00 years after the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the government , long - held <unk> are finally being challenged in <unk> <unk> .
in april , a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime .
in june , the government distributed a high school textbook here that for the first time teaches the history of the <unk> <unk> to the children of its former soldiers .
and in july , a joint <unk> and <unk> tribunal handed down its first conviction of a former <unk> <unk> member , sentencing the <unk> chief of the notorious <unk> <unk> torture <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , better known as <unk> , to 00 years in prison .
with each of those developments , anxiety has grown among <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , complicating efforts at reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into <unk> society .
" there is <unk> and fear among the former <unk> <unk> , but they are powerless to do anything , " said <unk> <unk> , head of the documentation <unk> of cambodia , an independent organization that <unk> the regime .
" for them , life under the <unk> <unk> was <unk> , but the regime has become symbolic of evil . "
" it is creating divisions within families . "
during the <unk> <unk> rule of cambodia , from 0000 until 0000 , an estimated 0.0 million people were executed or died from <unk> , disease or <unk> .
when the <unk> invaded and <unk> the <unk> pot - led government in 0000 , remnants of the regime and its military fled to cambodia 's border with thailand .
there they launched an insurgency that endured until the last of the movement <unk> in december 0000 .
as <unk> pot , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> directed the guerrilla war from their bases in western cambodia 's mountains and <unk> , <unk> <unk> cultivated a following in <unk> <unk> .
but in the mid - 0000s , after a <unk> - sponsored peace agreement led to the country 's first democratic elections in 0000 , large groups of <unk> <unk> fighters began <unk> to the government , <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in 0000 and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in 0000 .
<unk> pot died of natural causes in 0000 , and <unk> <unk> , who had held out , was captured by government forces in 0000 in the nearby <unk> mountains .
he died in a <unk> <unk> prison in 0000 while awaiting trial .
with their <unk> no longer providing for them , most former <unk> <unk> fighters have <unk> into the grinding poverty common in rural cambodia , and many remain <unk> for the movement .
although a few elite <unk> <unk> officials kept their local government posts in exchange for laying down their arms , the rank and file remain poor , unskilled farmers .
" these people have benefited very little following the surrender , " said <unk> <unk> of the <unk> for justice and reconciliation , which holds public forums throughout cambodia , including in <unk> <unk> .
" they are embedded with the utopian <unk> ideology of the regime . "
" they were brought up with no concept of doing business . "
<unk> <unk> , 00 , who joined the <unk> <unk> as a <unk> in 0000 , fought in the <unk> around <unk> <unk> before settling down to life as a poor rice farmer in 0000 .
" life under the <unk> <unk> was good , " he said .
" <unk> <unk> fed everyone . "
" but now , life is difficult because we have to provide for ourselves . "
the ongoing <unk> <unk> tribunal has also provoked worries here .
early next year , the court is expected to begin trying <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and his wife , <unk> <unk> , another former <unk> <unk> minister .
the court 's mandate is to prosecute senior leaders and those most responsible for crimes , but it has not said whether it will pursue cases beyond those four .
this has done little to calm fears in <unk> <unk> .
recent media speculation has <unk> on <unk> <unk> , 00 , who was a <unk> chief in <unk> <unk> province during <unk> <unk> rule in the late 0000s .
in 0000 , she told researchers from the documentation <unk> of cambodia that she had supervised construction of the <unk> <unk> dam , a project in which thousands of forced <unk> are thought to have died .
on a <unk> recent evening , <unk> <unk> returned from working in the fields to her wooden <unk> house on a <unk> road outside <unk> <unk> .
as the sun cast long <unk> across the <unk> grass , <unk> <unk> declined to discuss her past in the <unk> <unk> .
if the court <unk> her , she said , she would refuse to go .
" cambodia is at peace and stable , " she said .
" if there are more <unk> , there will be war . "
prime minister <unk> sen , who <unk> from the <unk> <unk> in 0000 , has also repeatedly warned that instability will occur if the court pursues more suspects , although experts and historians dispute that .
" cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past , " he has said .
but confronting the past is just what cambodia must do to move forward , said <unk> <unk> , of the documentation <unk> .
" reconciliation in <unk> terms is <unk> the broken pieces , " he said .
" it 's our obligation to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand . "
the <unk> produced the first government - approved textbook about the <unk> <unk> , the 00 - page " a history of democratic <unk> . "
it distributed it in <unk> <unk> in june as a supplement to the education ministry 's high school history textbook , which contains fewer than four pages about the <unk> <unk> .
as in much of cambodia , <unk> <unk> 's young people know few details about the <unk> <unk> , despite the town 's connection to the regime .
touch <unk> , 00 , a student at <unk> <unk> high school , said the new textbook was helping students understand an important part of their history .
but his parents reacted with <unk> when he took the book home to study .
" my family rejects many parts of the textbook and the tribunal , " he said .
" they are <unk> because they are not sure how many people the court will prosecute . "
such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult , <unk> <unk> said .
but the public forums , the textbook and the tribunal are beginning to have an impact , he said .
still , the <unk> <unk> retains a powerful <unk> here .
up in the <unk> mountains , a path overgrown with weeds and strewn with discarded plastic bags leads to a <unk> of black <unk> covered by a <unk> tin <unk> .
<unk> pot 's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 0000 .
<unk> <unk> , 00 , a roadside <unk> <unk> , said she did n't know much about the man who was <unk> there .
" but he has a strong spirit , and many local people go there to <unk> to him , " she said .
it was <unk> <unk> 's birthday , and later that day she planned to walk to <unk> pot 's final <unk> place , where she would leave a <unk> of ripe <unk> in hopes of bringing good luck .
belarus agrees to give up its stock of weapons - <unk> uranium
in a surprise victory for president <unk> 's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide , the government of belarus announced wednesday that it will give up its stock of highly enriched uranium , a critical component of nuclear weapons .
the deal was disclosed in a joint statement issued after secretary of state <unk> <unk> clinton met with <unk> foreign minister <unk> <unk> on the sidelines of a security summit here .
the <unk> government had been trying for years to persuade belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have hit a <unk> last spring .
but <unk> officials told the washington post that a pair of classified operations were carried out with belarus in the past two months to remove 000 <unk> of weapons - <unk> uranium from a <unk> research facility .
that set the stage for wednesday 's agreement to remove the rest of the material - about 000 <unk> ' worth , according to one official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter .
the agreement appeared to be one of the most important results of <unk> 's 00 - nation nuclear security summit in april , which excluded belarus .
and it was apparently good enough to secure the former soviet republic 's invitation to the follow - up summit , in 0000 .
" i was really fascinated by the fact they want a seat at the 0000 nuclear security summit . "
" that proves to me this process is working , " said <unk> <unk> , president of the partnership for global security , a group promoting nuclear security .
clinton called the agreement " a very significant , important step " by belarus .
<unk> pledged in prague in april 0000 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four years .
since then , the <unk> government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium .
belarus would be the seventh .
a dozen countries did so under the george <unk> bush administration .
at the time of <unk> 's nuclear security summit , <unk> president alexander lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium .
" we have kept highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons - <unk> and lower - enriched uranium , " lukashenko said then .
" this is our commodity ... we are not going to make dirty bombs , and we are not going to sell it to anybody . "
" we <unk> using it for research purposes , is all . "
belarus approached the united states a few months ago , however , indicating interest in reaching an agreement .
the first undertaking to remove belarus 's uranium , in october , was especially complicated because the material had been slightly <unk> , officials said .
it was <unk> onto a special train that <unk> more than 0,000 miles to a russian facility for storage and disposal , officials said .
the second operation concluded monday and was done by plane , according to the officials .
the <unk> government spent <unk> 00 million on the efforts , much of it to supply belarus 's research facility with low - enriched uranium , which is not suitable for nuclear weapons .
" this was very carefully coordinated and <unk> to build up the trust " that led to the agreement signed by clinton , said andrew <unk> , an energy department official working on global threat reduction .
the james martin <unk> for <unk> studies estimated this year that belarus had at least 00 <unk> of weapons - <unk> uranium , as well as hundreds of <unk> of highly enriched uranium .
belarus will aim to eliminate its <unk> by 0000 , according to the joint statement .
relations between belarus and the united states have been strained for years , primarily because of lukashenko 's harsh repression of human rights .
but wednesday 's statement suggested a potential <unk> .
" welcoming progress on these global security issues , the united states and belarus acknowledged that enhanced respect for democracy and human rights in belarus remains central to improving bilateral relations , and is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens , " it said .
the spanish government did not raise objections regarding the flights of cia
the spanish government did not raise objections regarding the flights of cia with taliban prisoners and of al <unk> that were going to guantánamo via spanish territory , according to the the usa ambassador in madrid 's telegram .
thus is reflected through the <unk> documents ( <unk> ) by <unk> to the newspaper el <unk> , where it is added that the first vice - president of the government at that time , maria teresa <unk> of the <unk> , asked that the spanish executive was informed in order " to be able to demonstrate that they had carried out appropriate monitoring procedures on the foreign aircraft that cross spain . "
in june 0000 , after a report of the european council where there were accusations of complicity in practices against human rights in a dozen countries , among which is spain , a meeting took place between the ex - north american ambassador <unk> <unk> and <unk> de la <unk> .
the vice - president recognized that the council 's report " had taken the government of <unk> outside the game " and insisted that spain did not have anything to hide regarding this matter .
" de la <unk> <unk> that spain does not raise objection for the intelligence flights over spanish territory . "
" they simply want to be informed " in order to avoid being " caught by surprise , " <unk> relates in a telegram .
also the ex - minister of external affairs , <unk> <unk> <unk> , indicated to the ambassador that the spanish executive " wanted to give this issue as little attention as possible , although being in the hands of the judges , the government had a limited influence . "
on the other hand , in january 0000 , the public prosecutor <unk> gonzález transmitted to the <unk> that he would not try to block the initiative of the judge of requesting the <unk> of documents of the national <unk> of intelligence ( <unk> ) and of the ministry of <unk> regarding the flights of the company "
this information does not contain any <unk> element nor any sensitive information , " explained the <unk> after speaking with the public prosecutor .
nevertheless , the usa reflected on its preoccupation for " the apparent coordination between the spanish judge and german public prosecutors , " more than the <unk> information of the <unk> or the ministry of <unk> .
" this coordination between independent <unk> will complicate our efforts to handle discreetly the case between governments " ; says <unk> .
in march 0000 during a <unk> between the ambassador of the usa and minister of the internal affairs , <unk> <unk> <unk> , this one <unk> to him that " although the spanish judges are <unk> <unk> of their independence and will do what they consider to be right , " he had given instructions to his collaborators " to avoid <unk> of <unk> rhetoric , in an attempt to reduce the temperature . "
the ambassador also expresses his preoccupation for the action of the <unk> in this matter .
" in spite of his pro american general orientation , our experience suggests that the <unk> wo n't doubt in <unk> any indication that the government of <unk> tolerated or deliberately ignored actions of the usa that could be interpreted as possible violations of the human rights , even if these <unk> have negative consequences for the government of the usa , " indicates .
the <unk> complained of the the " burden " of being a mother
the young lady spoke of the baby when he was already dead and she kept a blog : " terror of the <unk> "
<unk> <unk> <unk> is " <unk> " in the network .
with this <unk> , that she has used since since she was young , she communicated with a <unk> , and at least one friend , both of them from <unk> , the town of <unk> where she was born .
the messages are from 0000 .
in order to understand them , it is necessary to know the personal life that abc <unk> through her relatives ' <unk> .
the young lady from <unk> , 00 years , initiated a relation in 0000 with <unk> <unk> , an <unk> .
this affair lasted one year .
they decided to split , soon after they found out that she was pregnant .
he wanted to know if the baby was his , but his ex never allowed him to take the dna test .
soon after that she found someone else .
the man she chose was was <unk> , a man from <unk> , a <unk> municipality .
she remained with him for a long period of time .
caesar lived with them .
when the <unk> went to the balearic islands to test the labour market , the child remained with her au pair that accompanied her for one week in <unk> .
but in the content of her messages , one can see that their <unk> had ended , it was broken up .
in march 0000 in <unk> , single , she writes : " <unk> is very <unk> and upset , because i have come here to work . "
" when i told him this he seemed to be happy , sure , but now he <unk> how hard it is to stay with the child all day long and not to have the freedom of doing what he wants " ;
then , she speaks of a message received on her mobile phone that reads : " i want you to come this month or give me an address to which i can send you the child . "
she adds : " if he does n't like leaving the child with my mother , i will take him when i get back . "
in may , she speaks about her return to town : " i will go there this week , but i will only stay until the 00th , because on the 00th i must present myself at work . "
she clarifies that if everything goes well , she will keep her first - born child .
" from now on he will stay with whom he must stay , meaning with me and i will never in my life leave him again with somebody else except for my mother " doubtful intention given her bad relationships .
in july , there is another post .
when she writes it , it is assumed that the boy , who arrived at the island on the <unk> of that month , and supposedly was <unk> on 00th , is already dead .
" caesar is in contented on the one hand , but not on the other hand . "
on the one hand he is with me and he likes the location , but on the other hand he is going to classes almost every day . "
she speaks of a transfer to <unk> .
" he will go to summer classes there , and thus i can save some money . "
on the 00th , there are memories and complaints .
" <unk> from caesar , who asked me when <unk> come back . "
" <unk> says that he sent i do not know what videos to the <unk> and as you can see when he wants he can find me . "
on the 00th , another one : " the boy is well ; he goes to summer classes to learn catalan . "
about victor , there is one : " he gives me money . "
on the internet there are messages of her in <unk> dedicated to <unk> .
she even had one of her own in <unk> <unk> , where she called herself " <unk> the ex prisoner . "
" terror of the <unk> woman ( <unk> ) . "
the last man , who lived with her , <unk> his <unk> for feeling guilty .
he does not want to think that everything has happened for not having told him that she was a single mother .
<unk> entered yesterday in the provincial prison of <unk> , coming from the <unk> of judicial prisoners of <unk> .
carlos <unk> , the appointed lawyer , explained that he does not remember how the facts occurred , " nor that he had the intention to cause any minor pain . "
before , yes she <unk> that she had drowned caesar in the <unk> and deposited his <unk> in a <unk> .
the defence and the public prosecutor asked for a psychiatric test .
the popular would gain 0 seats in the congress and the <unk> would lose 0
with the results of the 00 - n , the <unk> could be decisive in the municipalities of <unk> , <unk> and barcelona
after the important increase in the votes and experienced <unk> in the recent <unk> elections , the catalan <unk> is already thinking to the general elections , is there and advance or not ? , the outlook is more than positive , since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections usually doubles the ones received during the catalan elections .
thus , the popular catalans obtained <unk> votes in the general elections of 0000 , whereas in the <unk> ones of 0000 , the number dropped to to <unk> .
last sunday , the ppc obtained <unk> votes .
if this upwards tendency ensures a transfer of votes <unk> votes and the loyalty of the electorate of the <unk> . analysts of this formation have calculated that , if general elections took place , the ppc could get from 0 to 00 <unk> in the congress , whereas <unk> would also gain four ( now it has 00 ) and the <unk> would lose nothing less than 0 <unk> ( it has 00 ) .
these calculations would observe that the catalan area is fundamental for <unk> and <unk> .
according to the opinion polls , <unk> would lose a deputy - it currently has three - whereas <unk> would remain with a deputy or would gain one .
but , if the electoral calendar remains established , the immediate appointment will take place in may of 0000 with the municipal elections , where the popular seats can also be decisive in the aim of the socialist <unk> in the four capitals of the province and their change to the front of the delegation of barcelona , one of the administrations that handles the biggest budget - 000 million euros for <unk> .
nationalists ' as much as popular ones coincide in the possibility that the <unk> loses the city councils of barcelona , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , where the socialists would not obtain the majority nor the possibility of appealing to their traditional partners , <unk> and <unk> .
given the republican fiasco , it would not be a surprise for this formation to lose its representation in the town hall of barcelona - it is needed to obtain 0 % of the votes .
the <unk> has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in barcelona , <unk> and <unk> .
the nationalists are convinced of being able to carry out the upset in the capital of <unk> , where they governed with the <unk> before the present socialist mayor , josep <unk> <unk> .
in <unk> , the <unk> has been placed only to 000 votes of the <unk> , whose mayor , <unk> <unk> , maintains very good relations with <unk> <unk> - during this last campaign , they met in several occasions .
the popular ones have also grown in other important municipalities like <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
at the moment , the <unk> is present in 00 municipal governments in <unk> and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations .
the catalan group facilitated thousands of passports to al <unk>
besides the seven prisoners in barcelona , in thailand there were three
the seven pakistanis and the nigerian one stopped by agents of the general barcelona police intelligence formed a jihadist group that , directed from thailand , facilitated passports to different groups of al <unk> , among them " the tigers for the liberation of <unk> territory " ( <unk> ) and " <unk> and <unk> " ( let ) , author this last one of the attacks of <unk> that caused the death of 000 people in 0000 .
the ministry of internal affairs has paid attention to these investigations , until the point of assuring that with " <unk> " operation ; it has been " weaken " the apparatus of falsification of al <unk> at an international level and , " therefore , its <unk> capacity . "
the <unk> calculate that the <unk> , during the two years that has been active in <unk> , has been able to send thousands of passports to thailand , where they were <unk> and soon distributed to the groups that integrate the criminal <unk> al <unk> so that its " <unk> " can cross the european borders and the ones of other western countries with total impunity .
the dismantled <unk> is not the only one that the jihadist network had in europe , for this reason in the investigations there have participated , besides the thailand services , other european police units , reason why it does not discard that in territory of the eu occur similar events to the one developed the night of tuesday in barcelona .
in coordination with this operation ( the pakistani <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and the nigerian <unk> <unk> were all stopped ) , in thailand another one had developed with the capture of the pakistanis <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the group seated in spain and other european countries was directed from <unk>
the catalan network - part of it was struck in 0000 - mainly <unk> passports to tourists who fulfilled the requirements marked by the call " worldwide islamic front . "
that is to say , the documents had to be in the name of men among 00 and 00 years , with validity of several years and without printed visas .
in the means of investigation it is <unk> that , for the moment , no data has been found related to the persons arrested in <unk> regarding the attack of <unk> , although the author of this attack , " <unk> e <unk> " , has been one of the receiving groups of the passports <unk> in spain and soon <unk> in thailand .
however , it should be mentioned that days before this committed attack , from <unk> there were sent through an agency of <unk> about some thousands of dollars that were " invested " in the purchase of mobile phone cards that soon were used by the members of the " <unk> " that ended the life of 000 people .
the policemen have captured a lot of documentation .
the <unk> asks <unk> to postpone the fiscal concert
the leader of the ppc , <unk> <unk> - <unk> , had yesterday was able to personally present her conditions for supporting his <unk> as president of the catalan autonomous government to <unk> <unk> , identical to ones already raised during the campaign and that resume themselves in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and giving up <unk> - sovereignty , as it is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the line of his mandate .
the president of the popular catalans went to the <unk> <unk> meeting with the security of having obtained 00 <unk> in last sunday 's elections , a number more than sufficient to be assumed popular , since the candidate of <unk> needs that at least one of the formations that will force the opposition to abstain in the <unk> voting .
on the possible agreement with the <unk> depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to remain in the congress when general elections are held , but , at the moment , the conversations that <unk> maintains with the rest of the political leaders in catalan is key .
as regards the president of the <unk> , for supporting an <unk> " she will have to make all the sovereign and independent speeches , " as well as the economic concert - similar to the one of the basque country - that the convergent leader tries to put under referendum .
both leaders have their gamble of using a very inflated <unk> administration and eliminating the <unk> and <unk> tax .
of the details of the negotiation on the <unk> of which <unk> will take care , on behalf of the ppc , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> has already met <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) - who promised a hard opposition , <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) and today he will do the same with <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> rivera ( <unk> ) and <unk> <unk> ( catalan <unk> ) .
the <unk> <unk> that the deaths were caused by " lack of means "
the owners of the <unk> of <unk> do not discard that their attendant killed more than 00 elderly people
the people in charge with the geriatric hospital la <unk> de <unk> ( <unk> ) offered a press conference yesterday in order to underline the damage that has caused to the institution the criminal conduct of <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> who while there killed at least eleven elderly people that he had under surveillance .
the director of the residence , <unk> <unk> , appeared accompanied by the centre 's lawyer , lawyer <unk> canada , and announced that " the intention of la <unk> would to pin the blame on the individual responsible for of the deaths but " legality and responsibility forces us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible people . "
and that besides the social loss of prestige that the organization can encounter for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the <unk> , the great threat for the <unk> has now takes the shape of of a substantial <unk> that is already calculated by the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims .
<unk> <unk> <unk> has <unk> that the first crime goes back to august 0000 and that since then he did n't stop killing .
the judge already mentioned in the document that ordered the <unk> of eight bodies - old patients of the geriatric hospital - whom she suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the dead bodies but , taking into account the age and the <unk> of the patients , the procedure was made by phone .
la <unk> , through its director , fully denied this end yesterday and mentioned that " the lack of measures could n't have been at any moment the cause of what had happened . "
the lawyer of la <unk> added that " in the cause there is no indication that there has been an <unk> action on the part of any other person who is not the guilty one . "
the one <unk> as " <unk> of death " <unk> 00 murders the day before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on the 00th of august of 0000 and a month and a half later , killed another <unk> .
in this case an overdose of <unk> brought her the death ; unlike the first crime he committed with a mixture of <unk> <unk> .
the director of the <unk> says that it is complicated to control that the personnel of the <unk> have access to medicines .
the overdose of <unk> and the <unk> cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the <unk> , in his <unk> to alleviate the suffering of the patients , used or killing them .
but the tests that are being carried out in the laboratory will have to clarify if <unk> is not lying and tried to assure for his first victims a less cruel death or if , on the contrary , burned them internally by giving them <unk> as he already <unk> that had done with the three women that he killed between the 00th and the 00th of october .
in la <unk> they do not give credibility to the appearance of the <unk> , nor to the number of <unk> murders , that they do not refute being superior , and justifies his attitude in the different versions that <unk> has given in his visits to the court and the nonsense of changing his method of killing after having successfully committed , eight murders .
this is why they say they put themselves at the disposal of justice to clarify the reach of this event .
the <unk> threatens
the investors suddenly reacted yesterday to the threat of <unk> that noticed that " the markets do not have to underestimate our ability to react . "
the <unk> of <unk> have closed by force and the rates of the european banks have raised more than 0 % .
however , we do not have to underestimate the capacity of the <unk> in being mistaken and the euro has just <unk> again which is a <unk> signal .
what happened yesterday is characteristic of a non liquid market that collapses and <unk> but motivated by the closing of short and very speculative positions .
the institutional investors will take time in <unk> confidence .
a month ago the <unk> called us today to retire liquidity measures and will spend time tomorrow to retire by fourth time in two years and those that are left .
the <unk> demanded to <unk> the plan of purchase of ineffective national debt and to eliminate all the extraordinary measures of liquidity on credit , leaving only limitless access by week .
after the irish crisis we hoped that they prolong the present measures of liquidity " at least until march " and maintain the quarterly auction with limitless access by the end of the trimester in order to guarantee the liquidity at least until june .
we also hope that they continue with their program of <unk> purchase and give signs of intensifying it .
if they do not fulfil the generated expectations they will transform the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue being blinded by <unk> liquidity measures , good lord !
as happened during the meeting of may when they affirmed that they had not contemplated the <unk> purchase and collapsed the markets , tomorrow history could repeat itself .
the <unk> must be credible and persistent .
in may announced the <unk> on monday and on wednesday said that it had already bought too much , bringing about a new collapse of the market .
the auction of <unk> <unk> once a year in portugal were very poor yesterday .
the <unk> only distributed 000 million to <unk> % , versus 000 million to 0.00 % of the previous auction .
even so the types in portugal fell 00 basic points in the entire curve , reflecting clearly a change in the market feeling after the words of <unk> .
in ireland , the <unk> and bank of ireland deficit <unk> had been made public .
the considered numbers are about <unk> million in the short term and another <unk> are potentials . until february they have to obtain private capital or will be <unk> .
although ireland does not have any credibility for not having detected the problem in july with the economic stress test , the numbers are acceptable within the plan of aid and help in reducing the level of uncertainty .
however , the next tuesday , the government will have to secure the parliamentary approval of its new budget and still does n't have sufficient support , reason why ireland continues being an uncertainty <unk> .
angela merkel has <unk> the tone of her speech in order to relax the tension facing the next summit of presidents and government on the 00th of december where it is necessary a political commitment that could demonstrate that we are a union and that goes in the same direction .
the problem is that germany wants to play <unk> and the rest the <unk> of joy of beethoven .
in spain , the president had the opportunity to present yesterday the set of measures that will be approved on friday by the cabinet .
the <unk> of pensions , transparency in independent communities and financial organizations , reduction of the deficit , liberalization , <unk> , measures for <unk> jobs sound in the ears of the investors as the four <unk> of <unk> .
the double effect of <unk> and <unk> explain that the spanish stock - market has raised <unk> % , double compared to the rest of european stock - markets .
unlike february , the reaction of the government and the bank of spain has been fast and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect .
today there is a key auction of a <unk> to three years that will be having the <unk> effect , reason why we hope that it will be solved with increased demand and will help <unk> the doubts on our capacity of <unk> .
for spain asking for a plan of aid would be a self sacrifice .
they would give us a line of liquidity that we did not need , the treasure has more than <unk> million available in liquidity the triple compared to march , to the most expensive types and closes the access to the markets indefinitely .
however , the strategy must continue being the one of the woman of caesar , " besides being , looking like . "
come on , we can do it .
the president of <unk> will <unk> the meeting of <unk> <unk> requested by his children
the storm does not moderate the <unk> family conflict , <unk> of <unk> and el <unk> .
david <unk> , founder of the group , will oppose , by considering " null and void , " the judicial meeting of en <unk> of the 00th , required by five of his seven children and when they try to impose their majority and take control of the management organs of the company that owns the <unk> <unk> warehouses .
david <unk> and his children <unk> david and maria jose are taking into consideration the legal <unk> for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for the control of part of the group .
the founder of the greatest holding company of enterprise services does not seem willing to give up in his litigation in order to be present in the control systems of el <unk> .
from his council of administration he was taken off by five of his seven children who appointed themselves administrators in the council of shareholders on 00th of january of this year and whose opposition is written down in the mercantile registry .
the judicial meeting of el <unk> arranged for the 00th , <unk> by the <unk> of mercantile affairs number 0 of madrid , has caused <unk> yet again in the <unk> family .
the appeal to the judge for determining the assembly is , until the conflict is solved , the single legal mechanism that guarantees the meeting 's convention .
the last actions of <unk> carlos , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , is described by david <unk> as a " desperate appeal by the representatives of his five children who , by means of procedural <unk> , clearly <unk> the law and abusing the right , try to confirm and change the meeting of the 00th of january as null , " according to his official spokesmen .
this <unk> will be the basis on which to establish that : once the meeting has been held , he will reject considering it " null and void . "
the same protagonists , who maintain a <unk> silence , have already tried without success to have the <unk> summon a meeting in june .
in el <unk> , <unk> society holder of the warehouses <unk> <unk> , among others assets , the seven children of david <unk> control the 000 % of the capital .
the founder of the service group claims , nevertheless , the <unk> on 00 % of the capital , according to the familiar protocols .
this subject is the basic aspect that has to be decided by the judge once celebrated the meeting on the demand of opposition , for which the date is no indicated yet .
red <unk> triumphs in f 0 with its secret weapon : <unk> .
there is software that can design improvements to the cars in real time .
since red <unk> entered the world of formula 0 in 0000 , its history in this select <unk> of speed has been marked by surprise and success .
initially nobody considered the options of a team that just arrived , in spite of the <unk> trajectory of the last <unk> , last november , in the final race of the <unk> all <unk> on the triumph of fernando <unk> 's ferrari .
without losing part of his reputation as champion driver , the german <unk> <unk> , nor the power of the renault motor that <unk> his car , in the world of formula 0 " the secret weapon that the multinational <unk> has put into the hands of red <unk> in order to turn it into a winning team has become a legend .
in fact it is powerful <unk> software that the german company marketed in 0000 with aims very far away from the high automobile competition .
<unk> <unk> , this powerful computer science instrument has been used to design assembly chains for manufacturing factories , energy plants , instruments of high precision .
the objective is to reproduce , to <unk> <unk> the product or the process before constructing it in a real mode , avoiding this way failures and <unk> expenses .
<unk> has facilitated the development of the cameras of <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> or the most famous <unk> cars of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , person in charge of the <unk> industrial division , explains that the use of this computer science instrument in his f 0 factory has allowed red <unk> to design and make " in a few hours , almost in time real , " the modifications , changes and improvements that are needed during the <unk> and tests .
<unk> explains that the team in 0000 had an average of 00 <unk> who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during every season .
red <unk> has 000 professional young people with high qualifications working today who , equipped with powerful computer science equipment , analyse and project all kind of modifications to the cars .
the <unk> manager explained that the software <unk> is able to analyse and improve all elements of red <unk> cars except for the engine , which is the entirely the responsibility of renault .
the materials , fuel , aerodynamics and elements of security are being modified .
the changes can be taken from the virtual reality of the <unk> to the reality in 00 hours , thanks to advanced production systems by means of <unk> and <unk> of high tech .
the only limitation of this <unk> of technological improvement is the figure of 00 million dollars that each team of formula 0 can spend at the most every season in order to facilitate the competition .
red <unk> has build a high - tech factory for designing and producing its cars in a locality about 00 km from london .
there are two buildings in which visits are restricted , especially for journalists .
everything that occurs there is considered " top secret . "
the factory has 000 employees , including its two drivers , the champion <unk> and mark <unk> .
the red <unk> hero , without any doubt , is the recent champion <unk> <unk> .
among the immense technological resources that the energetic drink brand has put to the service of its participation in the circuits , other protagonists hide whose contribution is <unk> and their <unk> unrecognised .
the head of technology at the factory , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that five years ago it was possible to affirm that the advances of i + d in the cars contributed to 00 % to the <unk> and the drivers were responsible for the rest .
today these percentages have varied and the technology adds 00 % of the success , while the drivers contribute with 00 % to the added value .
<unk> <unk> that neither <unk> or <unk> will never be replaced by computer science since " they are indispensable <unk> . "
<unk> will open in two years 00 own stores with local distributors
<unk> - <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> yesterday in barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner <unk> <unk> .
this it will be first of the network of 00 stores having among 00 and 000 square <unk> that the multinational anticipates to open in spain during the next two years .
the company will make compatible this initiative with the 00 areas already present in big <unk> as <unk> city , <unk> , <unk> and el <unk> <unk> .
the vice - president of <unk> spain , <unk> <unk> , gave as example the remodelled store located in the <unk> <unk> via , property of <unk> <unk> , with whom she collaborated for 00 years .
the north american group has prepared a plan to open 000 points of sale in europe in 0000 , strategy which includes the 00 spanish establishments .
the first ones to open were in bucharest ( <unk> ) and belgrade ( serbia ) the last week , being barcelona .
<unk> did not want to reveal the following possible <unk> , although she recognized that madrid could be the following destiny .
also the director of <unk> on personal systems assured that the philosophy to open the stores will be always the same , based on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector .
the north american group provides <unk> services and is in charge with the exclusive <unk> design of the stores ( with products that can be touched of interactive form ) , that in europe will have an identical image .
in addition , <unk> covers the formation of the personnel of the establishments .
<unk> <unk> denied that it was a system of <unk> and <unk> that the exclusive network of commerce tries " to improve the service towards the client and the smes in the purchase , the attention , post - selling and even packing . "
the barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program at a world - wide level that is in charge with solving the possible problems of a computer science equipment of <unk> still with guarantee .
an online service <unk> a technical <unk> located in the maastricht ( holland ) .
" thus , in 00 minutes we can resolve problems that sometimes can last up to two days . "
" this system is especially designed for smes and users , since the great companies already have contracted services of technical attendance , " mentioned <unk> <unk> yesterday .
<unk> <unk> on " stealing " one million clients from its <unk> in three years
more optimistic than other managers , the delegated <unk> of <unk> bank , <unk> <unk> , thinks that 0000 will be a hard year for the bank , but discards initially a new crisis of liquidity and predicts the end of the war of <unk> .
in spite of it , he anticipates a collapse of the margins of interests that will try to partly compensate with raised commissions and the price of the credit .
<unk> hopes to catch in three years a million particular clients .
<unk> has found a way of exploiting the next three years and being able to survive in very complicated economic surroundings .
the bank will start up in 0000 a new director plan that will have a validity of three years .
the objective , besides <unk> without needing to appeal to the public aid of <unk> , is to gain market quota by getting a million of new particular clients <unk> if are <unk> those that might leave the bank , pending on <unk> , since until now they spoiled more the smes and companies than the retail client .
this year has caught <unk> particular clients and <unk> companies .
its market quota of individuals is of <unk> % , whereas in companies <unk> 00 % .
another base of the plan 0000-0000 is the <unk> on productivity , meaning , of austerity , with reduction of costs as objective , and whose challenges will be <unk> by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise .
few banks dare during these times to set objectives and make them public since the financial crisis has changed all of the plans for the global bank .
<unk> , in fact , will close this year its director plan <unk> , <unk> four years ago , although initially it was for three , but the market conditions forced him to extend it into one more year .
the clients who give up savings will be his main objective .
during a breakfast <unk> by the <unk> , <unk> insisted that 0000 " is going to be a difficult and <unk> year . "
the executive , in fact , thinks that the exit of the crisis in spain " will be slow . "
in addition , in two or three years there will be " very difficult to create jobs , " something fundamental for the survival of the banking business .
and , although he thinks that the war of the <unk> - that <unk> the margins - is being reduced , the price of the risk subsidies that banks are paying for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity are already moving to the cost of the credit to compensate the fall of the margins .
the subject of liquidity and financing is fundamental , and is going to be a pressure factor on credit .
" we have n't closed the <unk> , but the <unk> are more important , " recognized <unk> .
<unk> already issued orders on thursday to his network to limit the long term credit and to raise the price of the <unk> - see <unk> from 00nd and 00th of november .
also he recognized that the tendency of the bank now " it is to raise the commissions , " but " within a competitive frame . "
the director plan of <unk> is based on the organic growth , although , as always , the group does not discard <unk> operations .
not in vain , <unk> that in spain " major sizes are going to be required . "
" next year everything will move , " he assured .
he <unk> that capital needs have " risen too much " and it does not discard that some spanish financial organization enters within red numbers .
and he mentions that the <unk> can replace the market in fundraising before new <unk> .
after assuring that <unk> can survive the temporary closing of the markets , he pays attention to which some <unk> already predicted as a new crisis of liquidity .
he says that there cannot be <unk> , but unlike to what had happened in june , is possible to obtain short term financing through agreements , which <unk> the crisis .
the <unk> discards a second big wave of <unk> in the saving banks
the chief of a main directorate of the <unk> , jose antonio <unk> , discarded yesterday that a big wave of <unk> of savings banks is going to take place and insisted once again on the speed with which the reconstruction of the sector is being made .
when the process of concentration of the spanish savings banks started , the there were several organizations that assured that they would not participate in this first stage and that they would be expect the second round .
nevertheless , the chief of a main directorate of the spanish confederation of savings banks ( <unk> ) , jose antonio <unk> , discarded yesterday that this new big wave of operations is going to take place .
i believe that the greatest part of the <unk> has occurred , the incorporation of <unk> to the group of <unk> <unk> cannot be called a second round , there are only adjustments .
" the biggest part is completely done ; perhaps instead of 00 we could have 00 or 00 but all the great processes have been done under the surveillance of bank of spain , that has collaborated very many to this matter , " pointed the manager .
in declarations during a breakfast of the manager association and executives of <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> has exposed that the concentration process is being undertaken " with the greatest possible speed , and we must be very satisfied of how this happens in the terms that at the time , not now , were marked in the plans of business with the bank of spain , " he <unk> .
to go from 00 saving banks with an average of <unk> million volume of assets to 00 with <unk> million is a process that does not have comparison in history , reducing the number of organizations to a 00 % so that they are much bigger to fulfil <unk> , he underlined .
<unk> recognized that there is " a series of opinions rather pessimistic on the slowness of the process " that demonstrates " a lack of seriousness and reason , " because " what the bank of spain does is to remember that we must fulfil the term before the end of year . "
the chief of a main directorate of <unk> , jose antonio <unk> , assured yesterday that spain has the more rigorous financial system of all europe and " probably " of the whole world , and he attributed to those who call into question the " lack of knowledge . "
the manager showed that , within the present economic <unk> , " we can be very relaxed " with the situation of the financial organizations and the savings banks , a system that has undertaken a " very important " concentration process and that " goes with the greatest possible speed . "
also he remembered that the spanish bank came out very well with the stress tests that the <unk> made in july .
<unk> and the german red line
berlin has chosen to maintain the euro , but has established the conditions for all the union .
the market tensions have brought about a double governmental response .
on the one hand , jose luis <unk> <unk> has suggested new measures of adjustment , from fiscal reductions to the smes , regulation of private agencies of positioning or suppression of the 000 euros of aid to unemployed without contributions , to the <unk> of 00 % of <unk> , the management of the airports of <unk> and el <unk> and of 00 % of <unk> of the state .
on the other hand , vice - president elena <unk> , with the support of the ex - president <unk> gonzález , has added to the critics to the <unk> angela merkel her responsibility in <unk> the present crisis .
how can those movements be interpreted ?
she continues that the position of merkel is not an error in her communicative policy .
on the contrary , it is another bolt tightening in the difficult process of <unk> of the euro .
and there germany has a radically new vision on how its future must be like , that contradicts the one of maintaining the old traditions of its main partners .
against the european resistance , in germany there are <unk> on three possible <unk> from the crisis .
first , a strong euro , integrated by itself , austria and holland , among others countries , while the south would leave the monetary zone .
second , the recovery of the german mark , although now seems to be science fiction , with a very favourable current of opinion , near 00 % of the population .
third , a <unk> of the euro , according to the german proposals of greater macroeconomic control , budgetary rigor , fines to the <unk> countries , possible <unk> of payments to some of them and extension of the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments .
the german position is clear and comes defining itself over a long time , so there are no excuses .
firstly , in 0000 , when as much the <unk> as the european commission stimulated the deficits , the german government presented a constitutional reform in order to prevent them from 0000 .
this was the first signal of divergence between what germany thought it had to do ( plans of fiscal strictness and stability in the public finances ) , and what its european partners were doing , including france .
the second <unk> for the central european country was when merkel <unk> extended the decision of rescuing greece .
then it was the object of <unk> critic , but the truth is that the political consensus in germany and the public opinion and the published one were against the rescue of greece .
finally , during the last days of october , merkel emerges again with a clear position , demanding the reform of treaties of the union , in order to make possible the rescue of a country and , at the same time forcing , the private <unk> to run with part of the cost .
this position has been interpreted as anti - european , since it has precipitated the irish crisis and all the rest .
but her proposal , although somewhat <unk> , has been approved and , in the next months , we would have to attend the process of reform of the union that makes possible those measures starting with 0000 .
germany has drawn up a red line that does not warrant crossing .
and it is saying to us all that , although now it has to take measures with which perhaps it does not agree , starting with that date the old functioning of the euro , will have been finished .
the 0000 will mean the birth of a new monetary area , in which the violating countries will be severely <unk> , can be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and , in that case , the private sector also will support part of the cost .
germany is telling us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high rates of saving and investment , moderation in consumption , improvements in productivity , competitiveness and positive balances .
another alternative based on the debt and the construction , with enormous deficits in the balance of payments , as the one faced by spanish growth during the years of the boom , will not be tolerated .
the offer is clear .
we should better understand it .
it is not about trying to lead back the public deficit to 0 % in 0000 .
what they ask us is much harder .
and the worst thing than we could do in these circumstances is to <unk> ourselves .
i hope that the present <unk> would open the path to a greater tranquillity
and that we take advantage of the time that they have given us , until the spring of 0000 .
it seems that president <unk> has understood it the same way and its double manifest ( the reforms promised after the meeting of the last saturday with the great companies and the announcement of yesterday of new measures ) suggests that , in spite of the critics to merkel , has laid way to the thesis according to which one should put order in the house .
but the red line that germany has drawn up there it is , and it does seem that is going be moved .
and , among the possibilities that are contemplated , the one of leaving a monetary zone of little serious countries cannot be excluded .
then , germany will always tell us that it had warned us .
sport and fraud law
tricks such as those of <unk> and ramos before the <unk> demonstrate <unk> but not the will to get remove of a sanction .
the expulsion presumably forged by two players of real madrid ( <unk> <unk> and sergio ramos ) in the game played on the 00rd of november against <unk> in champions league has caused rivers of ink to be written about if such behaviour is or is not <unk> and if , both players should be <unk> by uefa .
as we all know , a few minutes before the end of the game ( that their team had already won ) , both players deliberately wasted time which made the <unk> show the second yellow card to both of them .
this way , and since real madrid will finish as leader of its group , both players will fulfil the prescribed sanction during the next game of league , against <unk> , and will be able to get rid of the cards the following phase .
finally , the committee of discipline of the uefa has <unk> with two games the <unk> of the team , jose <unk> , and with different economic amounts the implied players .
the provocation of a yellow card in similar circumstances as this one is not a new practice , but rather frequent in the world of football .
it is so extended that it part of the ethos , of the <unk> rules , but followed nonetheless by this sport .
part of the debate arisen in the related case is caused by the fact that has been carried out by team of the real madrid organization ( that in its <unk> <unk> of <unk> and honour , and that has fined its players for <unk> acts ) and by the <unk> <unk> , apparently , by <unk> , who adds one more to his expanded history of <unk> and provoking <unk> .
anyway , the debate deals with if that type of behaviour not prohibited specifically by the regulation contradicts the principles of the sport , that is to say , if with these actions fraud is committed ; then , indeed , they are respectful actions with the sport regulation , but they seem to <unk> its sense .
the matter examines the type of damage that is brought to the sporting spirit .
one of the advantages that include the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players , aspect that with these actions was n't put into danger , that is to say , there was no violent game .
another of these advantages to which it is alluded to with the fare - play is to avoid that the team of the law <unk> players takes advantage unjustly of the opposite team , which did not happen either .
however , the paradoxical thing about the action of the players of real madrid is that it did not comply to what we normally <unk> as legal fraud , because the violation of the rules was not made <unk> as to try to avoid the sanction , but their action was most evident and thus they received punishment from the <unk> .
they waited for and accepted the sanction with no complaints .
another question is what type of advantage the <unk> obtained in the actions deliberately carried out .
here it seems necessary to state that it is n't a disadvantageous situation for rival nor is an obtained benefit in the same game , because evidently the result of the action <unk> leaving their own team with less players .
and neither is it a useful strategy for the next game , because the club will not be able to count on those players .
the advantage , obviously , consists in the fact that the players will begin the following phase of the <unk> without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game .
but it is about a long term advantage , with a certain degree of <unk> , because the team can be eliminated first of change , and in addition with this action the players fulfil a sanction game and go to the second cycle of cards , in which the suspension by card accumulation takes place with one less than in the first cycle .
so that , by passing rounds , it is not so clear that it is an advantage .
those actions are really against the sporting spirit , which is part of the strategic decisions that favour taking advantages allowed by the rules .
regarding this assumption , the players did not act in order to avoid the application of the sanction ( this would have been a clear case of legal fraud ) , but rather chosen when to obey it .
they made a strategic decision without avoiding the punishment .
although the border between the <unk> and the law fraud is diffuse , in this occasion i believe it was a clear case of <unk> .
the controversy seems to arise from two factors : because it was about two <unk> <unk> and the way the transmission of the directive was carried out to cause them .
the damage brought about to the principles of the sport by these actions is not as much ethical as <unk> .
offensive of supplies to catch christmas <unk> of groups in <unk>
the way the days fall this year , there is a concentration of reservations on the 00th and 00th .
the <unk> of the employees , who want to spend between 00 and 00 euros .
as <unk> and lottery , once with december the group <unk> before christmas return , that continue being an <unk> of fresh air for the restoration and leisure of barcelona , that because of the crisis has ended with an offensive of price fixing in order to be able to catch the majority share of customers : almost all want to spend between 00 and 00 euros on <unk> or <unk> , agree the managers and associations in the interviewed sector .
in order to finish complicating the accounting , the calendar of this year ( for falling the new year 's eve on friday ) concentrated the requests in the week of the 00th of december , with the result until that date of an <unk> of reserves of <unk> for weekend ( 00 and 00 ) and hardly movement for the previous week .
as was happening from 0000 , when the stage of cost - cutting began , there were many companies that have eliminated collective <unk> for budgetary reason .
for not <unk> the tradition , many workers maintain it by paying it out of their own pocket .
whatever <unk> , everyone demanded a price war , confirms the president of the <unk> restoration of barcelona , <unk> <unk> .
the representative of the employer 's association , today , does not dare to predict whether <unk> will be <unk> this month . "
" people consider it long before making the reservation . "
" they want to go out but they have in mind the price situation , " he mentions .
the business will go " well for those who give quality for good price and with good attendance , " he adds , and reminds that the clients tend to come down one step once with the crisis , so that the strip around the 00 euros has become a demand for the majority .
in a poll made in diverse <unk> establishments one can see the collapse of reservations for the night of the 00th .
<unk> group indicate that there is an authentic boom of requests for that friday , with the <unk> of spending no more than 00 euros , to which they have responded by adapting its <unk> with formulas of 00 and 00 euros .
in another of the most powerful groups , <unk> , with 00 establishments in the city ( <unk> de la <unk> , market , la <unk> and others ) , the <unk> of the calendar has involved more anticipated reserves , even since the beginning of november .
" we have done the impossible to maintain the same prices of the year last , with <unk> for all the tastes from 00.00 to 00 euros , " they detail .
in an <unk> , which involves el <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and up to a total of 00 bars , they remain optimistic after <unk> an increase of the <unk> from the second semester and some good , although concentrated , perspective of business for christmas .
sources of the group emphasize that the 00th will also be a <unk> day concerning friend groups that celebrate the holidays .
to their six <unk> of the group they have added a christmas one , with 00 euros or more as star budget and the perception that there is a <unk> to spend 00 % more than last year in exchange for demanding more details , if necessary .
they also see green <unk> in some companies that invite their employees and the <unk> the volume the better .
on behalf of the <unk> employer 's association ( that includes organizations like the association of bars , restaurants and leisure of barcelona ) , its vice - president , <unk> <unk> , believes he is beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel and considers that altogether the reserves are " <unk> , " although the clients " negotiate " as much as possible .
indeed , the illusion of celebrating has not decreased for whoever pays , indicates this one .
the pakistani nuclear program generates great <unk> in the usa
islamabad produces atomic weapons at " a rate faster than any other country . "
the <unk> of <unk> confirm the <unk> between the taliban people and pakistan .
the content of the correspondence between the american <unk> in pakistan and the department of state of the usa <unk> by the <unk> portal confirms the enormous <unk> which the pakistani nuclear program brings about in washington .
besides the enlightening and substantial details that are offered on the content of the conversations and the thoughts of the <unk> north american diplomatic representatives in islamabad , the documents reveal that the cooperation between both countries in the matter of atomic security , instead of increasing , " <unk> , " and that the unstable asian country produces nuclear weapons with " a rhythm faster than any other country . "
the <unk> of the pakistani nuclear program - that the arms are not <unk> but they remain stored by components to make difficult their destruction in case of attack <unk> it constitutes one of the main causes for concern in washington .
thus is enumerated by the ambassador in pakistan , anne <unk> <unk> , in a report previous to the visit of the ex - <unk> of national security , james <unk> : " the proximity of some nuclear power plants on the territory under taliban attack , the rumoured dispersion of the nuclear materials and the vulnerability of atomic materials transportation . "
the high number of people implied in the nuclear arsenals and the missiles <unk> is being taken into consideration , not only by the usa , but also by russia , such as the reason for maintaining its guard .
" pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs in order to protect the nuclear power plants ; given the poor <unk> and cultural levels , the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in the nuclear <unk> or of missiles , " said the expert <unk> <unk> , from the russian ministry of external affairs , in a meeting with his americans <unk> .
the newest information on the documentation <unk> by the portal of <unk> <unk> is the decreasing cooperation between the usa and pakistan in subjects of nuclear proliferation and the high pakistani rate of nuclear weapon production .
an office of the <unk> in may , that describes as " frustrating " the communication with pakistan , says that : " the transparency is frequently <unk> ; the offers of aid remain without an answer or are refused . "
in another message , peter <unk> , civil <unk> of the national intelligence for the south of asia , states that " in spite of the economic catastrophe , pakistan produces nuclear weapons in a rhythm faster than any other country of the world . "
the ambassador <unk> also asks washington , during a visit of the head of the army , general <unk> <unk> , to give clear orders to the person in charge that " the army of pakistan must end the tacit support to the terrorist groups . "
hunting of the head of <unk>
<unk> <unk> a person in charge of the <unk> fight in order to avoid new <unk> .
<unk> emits a red alert with the purpose of following the movements and locating <unk> where he might is .
all that is related to <unk> and its founder , <unk> <unk> , forms a complicated <unk> in which it is difficult to have certainty on any of the facts .
yesterday <unk> <unk> one " red alert " in order " to locate and follow the movements " of <unk> .
nevertheless , this is n't a traditional order of arrest .
in addition , it is n't new , because it dates from the 00th of november .
and has nothing to do with the last <unk> of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents pertaining to the usa but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the australian faces in sweden .
in addition , the lawyer of the <unk> of <unk> , mark <unk> , <unk> that " the police knows where and how to get into contact with mr. <unk> . "
it was day 00 when the international police body with headquarters in <unk> ( france ) issued the order at the request of sweden , but did not reveal it until yesterday , after receiving <unk> from the authorities of that country .
given the facts , the 000 countries of <unk> have indications for identifying or locating to <unk> " with respect to his provisional arrest and extradition . "
although the <unk> cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert , many of the member states , as the organization explained , consider the call network notice free way for making an arrest <unk> that has to undertake the national body of police , - especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition , as it is the case of sweden and england , where <unk> might be .
the movement <unk> the lawyers of <unk> , who published yesterday a letter denouncing that the founder of <unk> , 00 years old , declared being willing to take part in a video conference in order to answer any questions from the swedish authorities .
they also recall that <unk> asked and obtained permission to leave sweden from the public prosecutor in his case , whom they compare with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , head of security of <unk> .
" this seems to be hunting , not a legal persecution , " <unk> the letter .
while the world was searching for him - and from australia his mother defends the innocence of her son <unk> <unk> follows in unknown whereabouts , but not in silence .
on monday gave from an unknown place an interview to the director of the magazine time through <unk> , a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the secretary of state of the usa , <unk> clinton .
" if it is possible to show that she was responsible for <unk> american diplomats to <unk> in the <unk> violating international treaties that the usa has signed , she should resign , " he said .
his opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the white house , robert <unk> , who described as " ridiculous and absurd " the resignation request .
" i do n't know why we should pay any attention to the opinion of a man with a web page " declared the <unk> .
<unk> himself has ordered to a high person in charge with the <unk> fight , <unk> <unk> , to prevent new document leaks .
the attempt by the spokesman of president <unk> <unk> to reduce the attention paid to <unk> contrasts with opinions that politicians and commentators now proclaim .
peter king , the congressman who from january will <unk> over the committee of national security in the house of representatives , has asked the department of state to study the possibility of including <unk> in the list of terrorist organizations " in order to take part and his funds and to <unk> anyone who give them any contribution or help . "
furthermore went <unk> <unk> , an adviser of the canadian president <unk> <unk> , who had to withdraw his opinion after saying that <unk> would have to be murdered . "
" <unk> should turn him into an objective and use a non manned aircraft or something . "
who did not <unk> was <unk> <unk> , <unk> minister , ex - <unk> of <unk> and possible candidate to the presidency .
" whoever he is in the government the one who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not the execution would be a too much gentle punishment , " declared for fox .
<unk> looks for peace in <unk> with <unk> to those who have the same opinion as <unk>
the republican leader will allow the party a secret voting regarding his continuity .
<unk> proposes a more <unk> executive and the end of the full meeting system .
<unk> <unk> seems to have found the <unk> for negotiating for the <unk> time the internal revolt in the <unk> , without a sight for the loss of 00 <unk> and half of the votes .
the president of the party is conscious that his threat of resignation is insufficient for the supporters of the ex - leader josep <unk> <unk> - <unk> , but he also knows that the influence of that sector today is so <unk> as his own mentor and can cause the him worries that he had with other extinct currents .
for this reason , the leader of <unk> will try to gain the new critics with <unk> that allow him to be protected until the municipal elections .
in order to begin , <unk> announced yesterday that more than 000 national advisors of <unk> could pronounce privately on his continuity .
by means of tickets , and not by raised hand .
if the supporters of <unk> want to carry certain vote of punishment to the president , they can do it without fear to retaliation .
in fact , the head of the ranks wants to avoid the division image as much as the one of submission to him .
in several <unk> , he affirmed that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes , but added , without mentioning the percentage , that would n't be good either a result " a la bulgarian . "
the close supporters of <unk> demand the president something more than putting his position at the disposal of the <unk> , a gesture that is not worth when <unk> controls the most important organ between <unk> .
but for not having the majority sufficient to force resignations , they are going to try to decide with the executive a direction from now until may .
for this , they hope to participate in the <unk> of the document of strategic <unk> that the direction will put under voting of the national advice on day 00 .
its intention is to speak for <unk> in exchange for promising to advance the congress to the autumn of 0000 , something that the <unk> considers already done .
the <unk> leader recognized that " <unk> " harms stability and that its objective is to make , once and for all , the organization able to wash the dirty <unk> inside .
in this line , is symptomatic the article that <unk> in functions josep <unk> posted on his blog .
considering the <unk> <unk> , the holder of <unk> considers a fulfilled act that the leader will be <unk> " in exchange of diverse objectives . "
and he enumerated five , of which two are <unk> .
first , " <unk> " the executive so that it represents at least 00 % of the <unk> , that is to say , to include new faces that come from the sector compatible with <unk> .
the second can be the great <unk> .
<unk> proposes that <unk> eliminates the assembly as an operation mechanism .
thus , proposes a reform of the statutes that allows celebrating the <unk> through delegates chosen by suffrage .
ending with the assembly model , an exception in the spanish system of parties has been an obsession of the team of <unk> that already battled in this sense in both last <unk> .
in fact , the <unk> <unk> of the 0000 let the mission of direction review of the assembly in a specific congress of reform of statutes .
this meeting was n't held yet , because the internal flood of the last years advised against confronting the subject .
now , without critical sectors on the matter , could be a good moment to <unk> it and try to close it for always .

nevertheless at least one of them , the <unk> <unk> nelson from <unk> , has said that he will vote against , and only a republican has expressed his support to the law , richard <unk> from <unk> .
for this reason , those in favour of the dream act require gathering several <unk> in case other democrats decide to turn the back to the initiative .
among the most assisted <unk> are the senators of <unk> , olympia <unk> and <unk> <unk> , as well as the <unk> george <unk> , of <unk> , who completed the mandate of the <unk> <unk> martinez .
other <unk> who supported the dream act in the past are <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , from texas , but they have declared that they will not turn their back again .

the protagonist <unk> <unk> and concluded " on the sore i only managed to know that the real thing is open and that it does not exist , " but convinced that the <unk> and the tricks of the language have to be mixed .
<unk> , the writer , played with both .
the <unk> sergio <unk> also <unk> a <unk> <unk> that titled praise of the invention , where the finger on the sore is n't named but is discovered .
in broad terms of <unk> realism , he tells the story of a famous witch , who by touching <unk> , brought back men who had gone far away or repaired the virtues lost by a <unk> , <unk> that turned into speaking about america , a great novel which did n't lack from the very beginning its own <unk> who told it and mentioned <unk> <unk> del castillo who <unk> the excesses of the things told by the <unk> captains .
<unk> who invented us all ( the <unk> ) laughed of the false witnesses who appeared in <unk> presented as real , but otherwise he would have never told the history of america with imagination which lack <unk> .
nevertheless , he <unk> " crazy people and <unk> are those who best imagine things " and it is where reality and <unk> are mixed , where one knows if the <unk> thing belongs to one side or another , where the <unk> literature reaches its <unk> .

as for her , the writer <unk> <unk> saw and applauded the variety of interpretations that the invitation of <unk> causes with her round table the finger on the sore .
the cuban - <unk> <unk> pointed her own towards the great sore of the social violence that crosses her country - and divides latin america - product of the disputes on traffic and drug sale .
i believe that good literature , good <unk> , good <unk> lock up a tacit commitment that of course is not <unk> , indicated , after mentioning that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that settles down between author and <unk> , and that is one " chemical reaction " of this last one .
the night was closed by the spanish poet luis <unk> <unk> whose intervention also put emphasis " that the finger on the sore of the writer committed to writing . "
he considered that in a world that lives in a <unk> , also in the intellectual customs and control of the consciousness that it has effects in <unk> , forgetting " that behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind each negation there is small yes . "
" in order to be owners of our thought and reality we must clarify : and clarify often means to put the finger on the sore and to bother those people who are much more comfortable thinking about the <unk> , in black and white , in ideas established without a <unk> and also bothering to the powers that prefer a black and white world , " he said , inviting to recover the sense of writing .

already with santos <unk> , in the <unk> match of 0000 , again before los <unk> , <unk> suffers again a reverse , since his team finished equally places 0-0 before the <unk> makers after 000 minutes of game , but in the turn of penalties put himself in advantage by 0-0 with two opportunities to seal the title but finally three players failed from the 00 steps and suffered the change 0-0 .
<unk> already lost two <unk> with <unk> <unk> and one with <unk> , its rival in turn , therefore he does n't want to endure the same fate , he wants to celebrate a title for the first time , and he <unk> that the most important thing for him is the institution .

very effective he has the previous final , from which , he <unk> , has learned much , " the only lesson we can learn is that until the <unk> signals the end we cannot celebrate , we prepare ourselves as well as the players because the previous time , with two penalties we were about to leave and i believe that is an lesson to be learned , we cannot celebrate until the game ends . "
knowing that this series could be defined in penalty kicks , something that does n't trouble him , because he trusts his players : " one should never looks for going to penalties , but rather to finish in regular time ; sometimes you do n't have any alternative and it is necessary to be ready ; in the previous match we were prepared , unfortunately destiny played into our hands ; sometimes by <unk> or anxiety for having the title in out hands , but we did n't reach this goal , and this left us something for this final that we hope to win . "
roman should stop being a technical runner - up and <unk> for the first time the glory that the titles give .

when calling the press , nasa assured that it will present " a discovery that will cause impact in the search of <unk> life , " which provoked speculation by experts in other countries .
the discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures that look like us living in hostile spaces that are thought of as <unk> , and would put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve their living conditions .
apparently it is centred around a <unk> that was found at the bottom of the <unk> lake in the national park <unk> , california , where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life , since the lake is rich in <unk> .
somehow , the <unk> uses <unk> as a means of survival and out of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist in other <unk> that do not have our <unk> environment .
according to <unk> , if these organisms use <unk> in their <unk> , it will be demonstrated that " indeed there is another form of life , a second form of life , different from the one we know . "
the space agency will present the full extent of the discoveries in the press conference of tomorrow thursday .
<unk> <unk> , who studies the possibility of life in mars ; and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , one of the scientists who study <unk> ( the greater <unk> moon ) , under the perspective that its <unk> is similar to the one of the earth will both attend the conference .

he detailed that in the near future they will speak with the representatives of pan and <unk> to modify the scheme , starting from a political will , and if they do not have it , then they will be dominated once again by both parties and in this way the competing coalition was brought to a close .
how far they have got ( the competing coalition ) , is what i see , because we are excluded , from any decision , they do n't even have the political deference of considering the opinion of the rest .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , mentioned that with the <unk> , pt and <unk> , there are <unk> and for that reason they are forming a <unk> group .

in order to begin , this group is initiating with 0 legislators , and is talking with other companions so that they could be more , added the convergent .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , from the pt , explained that at the moment the congress became a " plunder " between two , with reference to pan and <unk> . "
before it was only one party , now it is being divided between two . "

he said that the bad conditions of the streets and the side - <unk> have affected because the tourists come to take a walk and see the disorder and they avoid the complementary businesses .
the politicians do not know what it means to close for one day and do not have any idea about the amount of money that is lost , or otherwise they would n't do the jobs this way in such a long period of time and without previous planning .
the <unk> jose <unk> <unk> <unk> said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance from the part of the city council .
" the municipality will have to assume its responsibility and to avoid this happening again , by giving preventive maintenance and not doing only the correction , " he said .
we look forward to enjoying a clean city , because not only must the area be given the maintenance , but as inhabitants who deserve a clean site to live on ; the city council must change its strategy in order to maintain good living and visiting conditions .
there are other sites that are also neglected and incomplete , he said , as for example el <unk> and the <unk> de <unk> .
" nowadays , for the tourist to come does depend only by the promotion , we must have a good product , a city that has clean beaches and avenues , permanent maintenance of the attraction areas , " he said .
" there was n't enough attention paid and this underlines something that is well - known by all , that maintenance is a must . "

he spoke of a series of places that has to align altogether with the municipality and to be a priority having the city always , clean , ordinate and attractive because it is a <unk> city .

for that reason he spoke about certifying the commitment in order to establish the necessary bridges that could help the <unk> to go ahead .
we hope that they come to do a worthy work and mainly committed to the society and the sectors because the <unk> of <unk> were those who gave them the vote of confidence during the last elections .
jose <unk> <unk> <unk> , president of the association of hotels <unk> <unk> , considered that one of the greatest challenges for the 00 popular representatives is the one of pushing and adding forces in search of the economic growth of the state , because nowadays the economic situation is very complicated .
the most important thing is to push economic growth , that generates incentives for investment and infrastructure and that somehow will form a new generation of jobs .
as for the tourist activity , he demanded that the new legislators give the weight revised within the state budget in order to <unk> the secretary of tourism .
as i have understood this is the second department of the state with fewer budgets and is <unk> an important and economic activity generating <unk> and investment and that directly competes with the <unk> industry .
apart from requiring labelling resources the <unk> tourist projects that help giving security to the state and update the alcohol law that has not been able to solve in the previous <unk> .

for his parents , the next day of <unk> will be difficult to please his illusions , since their home is made out of no more than 00 people and a <unk> .
nevertheless , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , jose <unk> , maria <unk> , <unk> , jose <unk> and <unk> do not lose the hope that <unk> , <unk> and <unk> will give them the toys and clothes they so much wish .
the family lives in a <unk> house of the colony salvador <unk> and lives in poor conditions because the father does not have a job .
sometimes it is very hard for us because my husband does not have a job , but we sell mandarin and daddy ... in the afternoon i leave with the kids to sell in the street , " said <unk> <unk> <unk> , mother of the children .
<unk> , 0 years old , wants a <unk> or a bicycle , while her <unk> <unk> , 0 years old , would like a barbie <unk> .
on the other hand , jose <unk> , 00 years old , has wished for a very long time to have a " monster " car and for his brother <unk> , 0 months old , <unk> suggests clothes suitable for a one year baby .
he told me ( jose <unk> ) , i would like this monster , " but i said " we will see son " because it was very expensive , " remembered <unk> with sadness .
for the <unk> children that were at school clothes and shoes would be perfect .
maria <unk> , 00 years old , is size 00 ; <unk> , 00 years old , is size 00 , whereas <unk> , 0 years old , uses size eight .

clandestine migration can be pursued without <unk>
according to the government , the conservatives ' draft law should solve the problem of <unk> of illegal migrants , but will in all probability be defeated , since the three opposition parties announced on wednesday that they could not support it .
" i strongly rely on the charter . "
" i support <unk> party , which created the <unk> beneath your feet " declared the liberal chief michael <unk> , surrounded by <unk> after the <unk> <unk> meeting .
the liberals claim that the draft law in its present form which would <unk> any person from a ship identified as carrying clandestine immigrants , would violate the canadian charter of rights and liberties .
the chief of the <unk> block , gilles <unk> has also said that he could not support the draft law , because its aim is wrong .
" we are opposed and it appears that all the opposition parties are opposed and we will now see what the government does " declared <unk> <unk>
the critic of <unk> concerning immigration , <unk> <unk> , has rejected the out of hand the criticisms <unk> that her party was not firm enough about illegal immigrants .
" the neo - democrats approve the taking of steps against persons handling illegal immigrants and this is what we are doing by means of another draft law , the c - 00 " stated mme <unk> .
" we do not support the conservatives ' draft law because it attacks refugees and <unk> their children for at least a year , " explained mme <unk> .
the minister of immigration . <unk> <unk> , accused the opposition parties of playing politics and of ignoring the will of <unk> .
" <unk> are telling <unk> loud and clear that they will not tolerate this kind of illegal immigration , these criminal operations which target canada and which treat the country like a <unk> . "
" they expect canada to adopt firm measures " was the reaction of minister <unk> .
the government has not announced a vote of confidence on the draft law , which could bring about elections in the event of its rejection .
a conservative has however told the <unk> agency that the government would ask for a vote so that every opposed deputy shall explain his reasons to his electors .
the new unity does not create unanimity
despite the announcement by jean <unk> of the possible creation of a permanent unit for combating corruption and <unk> , numerous observers continue to demand the creation of a commission of public inquiry into the subject .
the minister of public security , <unk> <unk> , asserts that this idea is not new : <unk> consulted the new york department of investigation on the subject last january .
the <unk> has had a permanent anti - corruption unit since 0000 .
nevertheless , the tuesday announcement surprised more than one person .
it must be said that at a <unk> of the <unk> permanent police council last 00 october this step was never discussed , notwithstanding the presence of robert <unk> .
it did not need any more than that the public security critic <unk> <unk> should call this announcement a " <unk> produced out of the <unk> " and as " a solution thrown together on the corner of a table "
minister <unk> replied to those fearing that political power would have too much influence on the possible future unit .
" you will see the result when it is announced , he contented himself with affirming . "
" one is aware of that problem . "
as far as the president of the <unk> , <unk> parent is concerned , nothing can replace the launch of a public inquiry .
" the more <unk> <unk> <unk> refuses to create this commission of inquiry , the more people will think like you and i that there is something to be hidden , " he explains .
" the only way to get a commission of inquiry is for jean <unk> to resign " explains <unk> <unk> , professor of ethics and government at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
in order to get out of this impasse he therefore suggests that <unk> should give a special mandate to the general <unk> for the latter to inquire into <unk> and corruption .
" one must be able to broaden the mandate of the general <unk> , " he decides .
he also feels that <unk> could <unk> on the <unk> the same powers as those of a commissioner , allowing the former to compel people to testify .
the creation of a permanent group of people is not the only project on the <unk> government programme .
<unk> would also ask ottawa to modify the criminal code , to make it more suitable for this type of crime .
this request would come from the prosecutor of the <unk> operation , who informed the minister of justice jean - <unk> <unk> that precedent is not explicit on this type of inquiry .
the federal minister of public security , <unk> <unk> confirmed that his colleague at justice , rob <unk> is currently inclined to introduce certain amendments .
at the time of the spring 0000 operation , which targeted groups of motor cyclists , even though the criminal code had not been adapted , 000 persons were arrested ..
ottawa subsequently ruled to adopt the law on <unk>
rivers under close surveillance
several water courses continue to be under close surveillance due to the heavy rains falling in several regions of the province since tuesday
a land <unk> occurred on wednesday afternoon at <unk> in <unk> .
two houses were <unk> as a <unk> .
in the evening another land <unk> occurred at saint - <unk> - <unk> in <unk> .
a road collapsed .
between tuesday and wednesday evening heavy rain ( from 00 to 00 <unk> ) fell in several regions .
between 00 and 00 <unk> of additional rain were expected between now and thursday evening depending on region .
sectors north of the river and in <unk> alley were worst affected .
they received a total of up to 000 <unk> of rain .
since these falls will be added to the <unk> of snow already lying in certain sectors , the overflowing of several rivers is feared .
flood <unk> were issued on wednesday evening by <unk> civil security for the rivers <unk> and <unk> in <unk> .
the rivers nord in saint <unk> , in the <unk> and <unk> in <unk> were the object of flood warnings and remained under surveillance .
in the <unk> region , heavy rains caused the overflowing of certain lakes at <unk> - <unk> , <unk> - <unk> - de - <unk> , as well as at <unk> .
at <unk> - <unk> , a provisional bridge was swept away by heavy rains .
ten dwellings had to be <unk> as a <unk> .
in the <unk> , the overflowing of certain lakes entailed the closure of several roads , in particular in the municipality of <unk> - et - <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , a security consultant , stated that civil security continued to be in a state of alert and was monitoring the situation closely .
on wednesday , <unk> flood forecast centre issued flood warnings in respect of several rivers , in particular <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> partly blamed
the <unk> radio <unk> <unk> <unk> suffered a partial reverse before the canadian radio and television standards council ( <unk> ) on the subject of social assistance and <unk> , as well as on that of his coarse language whilst on air .
<unk> <unk> feels that <unk> <unk> and his team of <unk> 00,0 <unk> had the right to express their views , but that certain topics contained " inexact information on social assistance , unduly negative statements concerning <unk> and coarse language not suitable for <unk> <unk> . "
the council also concluded that a discussion about suicide including the broadcasting of the names of two persons who had committed suicide , did not infringe broadcasting codes .
the <unk> had received several complaints on the subject of comments made during <unk> between 0000 and 0000 .
the first decision was given following a complaint by the <unk> common front of persons receiving social assistance .
the group complained that the sums quoted in the <unk> were not accurate .
the <unk> must present solid , not <unk> information .
concerning suicide , the <unk> <unk> <unk> felt that suicide was the action of a <unk> .
the majority of members of the committee concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution of life 's problems .
" the majority of the committee feels that the <unk> in question of " <unk> <unk> " approached a delicate subject in a balanced and appropriate manner . "
accordingly , no blame attached to him .
the last dispute concerned the declarations which followed the haiti earthquake .
<unk> <unk> and jean - <unk> <unk> then had a face - to - face media discussion , which gave rise to a lot of reactions .
the <unk> <unk> declared that he had not made any contribution to help the <unk> , because one could not be certain that the people in need really would receive the money .
the committee believes that the comments were not improper , but that their cumulative effect concerning <unk> was unduly negative .
" i have already served my three - day suspension there . "
" my record has now been clean for eighteen months , " declared the <unk> .
in all its decisions the committee condemns the broadcasting of coarse language .
the <unk> <unk> - <unk> collaborated " beyond the call of duty " in all cases .
the consequences are minimal for the station which must , inter al , announce these decisions once during the hours of maximum audience within three days .
the king of <unk> - <unk> in montreal
the montreal resident of <unk> origin , <unk> <unk> , has an extremely individual programme .
the athlete , who <unk> at " <unk> " ( " full contact " <unk> - <unk> ) , at <unk> and at <unk> <unk> , is entering the <unk> and the rings of the world in search of fresh <unk> .
" i started practising martial arts such as <unk> - <unk> and <unk> 00 years ago in algeria , " explained <unk> who has lived in the capital since 0000 in order to train with professionals .
" in my case i look for fights everywhere , since for those who do not like the floor fights present in mixed martial arts , competitions in north america are rare . "
recently , the man working as security agent for the ups company , had bad news for his <unk> , having gained two gold <unk> in the amateur world <unk> of the world <unk> and <unk> association ( <unk> ) held from 00 to 00 october in edinburgh in scotland .
" i won in the classes of full contact <unk> and <unk> <unk> , " he explained .
" i am currently preparing to go to china for the san <unk> world cup . "
" competitors who finished among the first four <unk> the preceding world <unk> in each class , were invited . "
" in <unk> in 0000 i won the <unk> <unk> . "
" in vietnam in 0000 , i finished <unk> . "
" i finished fifth in the 0000 <unk> in china and third in <unk> in 0000 , " he added .
" what is interesting is that i did better at each competition . "
" at this rate i will be first this year , or next ! "
the " san <unk> " or " <unk> " is an original chinese <unk> , where <unk> and kicks , as well as throwing to the ground is authorised .
the fights take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring .
the most famous <unk> from this form of combat is the american of <unk> origin , <unk> le , well known in the world of martial arts .
if <unk> <unk> is asked to recall only one event of his career , it will surely be his participation in the " king of <unk> " <unk> in the <unk> - <unk> super <unk> .
" this competition is the most often mentioned and the most <unk> in china , " explained the agreeable , <unk> young man .
" it is the equivalent of the <unk> stadium , ( the largest stadium in thailand ) . "
" it was a super experience . "
<unk> won his first fight , a semi - final in his class ( 00 kg ) , before losing in the <unk> .
" the man who beat me was a real professional " he analysed .
" there are four fighters in each class ( 00 kg , 00 kg , 00 kg and 00 kg ) "
" the winners of the semi - <unk> fight one another in the <unk> of their class . "
" the winners in each class fight one another for the title of a <unk> champion , the king of <unk> - <unk> . "
000 <unk> ' worth of contracts without calls for tender
hydro - <unk> awarded 000 million dollars ' worth of contracts to engineering companies for the <unk> - 0 - a - <unk> - <unk> hydroelectric project .
at the core of this <unk> of over 000 contracts is a <unk> formed by the companies <unk> . <unk> , <unk> group and <unk> , which secured the most important one , that of managing the project for the sum of 000 million dollars without a call for tender .
the <unk> called <unk> <unk> was formed in 0000 , leaving it to hydro - <unk> at its option to pass its responsibility for managing this important hydroelectric project worth 0000 million dollars to the private sector .
at the beginning of 0000 the <unk> <unk> <unk> secured this lucrative contract without a prior public call for tender .
as far as the <unk> party is concerned , recourse to company <unk> poses a serious problem , that of elimination of competition and of an increase of price .
" this is the new way of <unk> and defeating competition . "
" this means that rather than behaving <unk> , people now behave openly , " declared the <unk> party deputy <unk> <unk> at a press conference .
earlier during the morning <unk> <unk> raised the question in the national assembly , because he found it difficult to see how the public interest could be served in that way .
replying in the afternoon , the minister of natural resources <unk> <unk> , denied vigorously any <unk> in connection with this contract .
" i am starting my journey , " she <unk> , maintaining that the <unk> party had been " dishonest " and " lacking rigour . "
she said that " it would be the least thing " for the <unk> party to excuse itself .
the formula of the <unk> is current practice throughout the world .
what is usually involved is an alliance limited over time , which allows two or more companies to combine their respective <unk> in order to respond to a call for tender for a complex project .
the <unk> project comprises a high level of complexity , taking into account the extent of the works .
the site is in progress and must extend until 0000 .
the contract was awarded without involving competition ; there were negotiations .
likewise , the formula of <unk> is no longer an exception in <unk> , even in respect of relatively simple projects .
as was disclosed last week by le <unk> , the formula of <unk> in the engineering <unk> sector is the subject of a government inquiry .
a brief inspection of the register of <unk> companies shows the <unk> of over 000 <unk> , some of which appear to be permanent .
so , for example , the <unk> company works in partnership with the majority of its principal competitors , including <unk> + , <unk> , <unk> - <unk> and others such as <unk> and <unk> .
every combination and there are tens of them , comes back to one and the same company , namely <unk> .
as far as the <unk> <unk> <unk> is concerned , minister <unk> stressed that " the territory of the <unk> james complies with the specific labour dynamics and that hydro - <unk> has complied with them specifically since the <unk> <unk> . "
the head of the <unk> project , <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> de la <unk> james ( <unk> ) gave an explanation , which raised <unk> about the fact that the project management contract had been awarded by mutual agreement .
" if you launch a call for tender and if there are few <unk> , your prices will be too high . "
" you have two options ; either you accept the people who are in that market and you say that we will negotiate a satisfactory alliance and a good price . " or you take the people who are in that market and you say that we will negotiate a <unk> alliance and a good price . " we will negotiate a satisfactory alliance and a good price . "
" but the idea is that it is not the price which is <unk> , but people 's skills " stated <unk> <unk> .
this contract awarded to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , forms part of a long list of contracts of over 00 000 <unk> secured by the <unk> <unk> .
the contracts were awarded by hydro - <unk> or <unk> for the <unk> - 0 - a - <unk> - <unk> project .
following verification , le <unk> counted 000 engineering <unk> contracts <unk> between 0000 and 0000 to companies or to their <unk> , especially soil laboratories .
<unk> - <unk> <unk> 00 contracts , <unk> 00 , <unk> 00 and <unk> 00 , not counting its participation in <unk> <unk> .
all the contracts were negotiated .
they total 000 000 000 <unk> , including the contract awarded to <unk> <unk> worth 000 000 000 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> let it be known that the four companies <unk> the <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> , group <unk> and <unk> ) are " well known to <unk> liberal party . "
minister <unk> let slip that the <unk> party is also linked to these companies who " finance " it , before stating that it was rather its directors , who were involved .
barometer of the responsible consumption - the " green " label does not inspire confidence .
greener , but frankly sceptical .
the <unk> consumer has little confidence in durable development players , but also in equitable brands and in certificates claimed to be ecological , to guide his choice .
worse , if he <unk> himself in the <unk> of the media where messages in favour of more <unk> consumption <unk> , he deplores the lack of reliable information , a piece of neglect which he even describes as a brake on his commitment , indicates the barometer of responsible consumption whose first reading took place today .
even if they brought about an increase of consumption of so - called socially responsible products in 0000 , <unk> inhabitants appear to have little faith in those who are trying to sell it to them .
two - thirds among them say in effect that they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies , or their green publicity <unk> the tool of <unk> drawn up by the responsible consumption observatory of <unk> university .
another finding : half of consumers <unk> doubts concerning the reliability of official certifications appearing on so - called equitable products , but also concerning the credibility of products and brands marked as eco - responsible , indicates the barometer .
in the same vein , the talk of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 00.0 % of <unk> inhabitants .
nevertheless , information concerning responsible consumption appears to be fundamental for the stimulation of this kind of current consumption by two - thirds of <unk> inhabitants .
in fact , the vacuum and the doubtful nature of the information would <unk> the <unk> of 00 % of consumers .
it is the second most important brake after the higher price of these products identified by the barometer .
moreover , two - thirds of <unk> inhabitants say that they mistrust the alleged <unk> of " green " products or services which are being placed in their hands .
on another note , in 0000 almost half the consumers had to change <unk> habits and most importantly to change the brand of one or more of their products , to reflect their conviction .
up to 00 % of them thus favoured buying from their local shops and preferred foodstuffs grown in their region , indicate the barometer .
greener and more responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 00 out of a maximum of 000 for this year - the <unk> <unk> <unk> likes to appear as the king of <unk> trying to reduce its environmental <unk> by worrying about the protection of animals .
but its social and ecological conscience nevertheless appears to be restricted to the outside of its vehicle , indicates the barometer : in 0000 , scarcely 00 % of <unk> inhabitants stated that they used public transport or recommended its use in order to defend their green interests .
walking and cycling were also supported by 00.0 % of participants in this huge <unk> inquiry .
a state loan for the purchase of the <unk> .
the <unk> government which was asked to become financial involved in the purchase of the <unk> cinema complex by the <unk> and parallel company , agrees to collaborate , but only in the form of a loan .
the <unk> and parallel development company which hoped for a grant of seven million dollars from the ministry of culture to purchase from daniel <unk> the cinema complex <unk> on <unk> saint - <unk> , restoring to it its full <unk> vocation , will not secure what they are asking for .
the government agrees to become involved , but on its own conditions .
rather than the expected <unk> , the <unk> government is offering a loan which will be less than initially expected and which could be a viable solution on advantageous conditions , at least according to state sources .
a first plan of action and a request for 00.0 million were already rejected by <unk> last spring , but the requests have since been revised downwards .
a proposal <unk> an action plan were sent to minister st - pierre by the chairman of the <unk> <unk> des entreprises <unk> ( <unk> ) françois <unk> , who is <unk> the <unk> file .
he sent him a final report ten days ago .
but the counterproposal of the cabinet arrived at <unk> on tuesday .
<unk> and <unk> have until 00 december to reply to it .
it nevertheless appears that the assumption of a <unk> must really be abandoned .
let us recall that the <unk> of <unk> owners of <unk> and <unk> opposed direct state investment to assist the purchase of <unk> , arguing that the ministry of culture does not have to finance real estate projects , which it did not do for other <unk> .
but several local players , on the other hand , claimed substantial economic help .
daniel <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , supported the author 's cinema on the complex premises after having himself financed its construction , which was able to justify a waiver by the <unk> .
there is a crying lack of halls for showing independent films in montreal and <unk> knew how to gain the loyalty of its customers .
the <unk> company and the parallel , headed by christian <unk> , are <unk> a private financing campaign , hoping to collect 000 000 <unk> to make the <unk> possible .
since spring 0000 , one of the three screens , the parallel , continues to <unk> <unk> films .
the aim of future purchasers is that of reopening the three halls on 00 february , showing the very beautiful film by <unk> <unk> entitled " men and <unk> . "
but cristian <unk> has not called back le <unk> and it is not known what he and his group think about the proposals for a reduction , which have been made to them .
the veil lifted on a complex canada <unk>
the new american diplomatic <unk> divulged by <unk> have lifted the veil on what the united states consider to be an <unk> complex of <unk> towards americans , but they also <unk> a <unk> complex of the later towards canada .
thus , american diplomats are astonished that every canadian <unk> does not have <unk> - american relations at heart when voting and believe that the visit by president <unk> helped the conservative government to have its 0000 budget adopted !
the four new communications between the american <unk> in ottawa and washington published yesterday , give more <unk> details to get one 's <unk> into .
a <unk> dated 00 <unk> 0000 , in the very middle of the federal election campaign , tells to what extent the united states form part of the stakes being debated by political leaders .
to the great <unk> of the american ambassador in ottawa , david <unk> .
mr. <unk> offers some explanations of this situation .
" an almost inherent canadian <unk> complex is perhaps inducing canadian political leaders to speak about everyday internal stakes , rather than blame this election on the united states ( as during the free exchange campaign of 0000 ) .
the united states therefore are , he concludes , " the proverbial elephant of this election : <unk> , but potentially too threatening to be talked about . "
the ambassador understands this " <unk> silence " all the less , since the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship .
" logically , " he feels , " the ability of a candidate , of a party and even more of a party leader to <unk> this essential relationship must be a key factor , which the voters have in mind when voting . "
the other expression of this important sentiment is found in the <unk> sent on 00 january 0000 by terry <unk> , <unk> <unk> in ottawa , preparing president <unk> <unk> for his first visit to ottawa .
" your journey will help ensure the government 's survival of the vote of confidence at the start of february on the federal budget , which will post canada 's first deficit for over ten years due to a relaunch plan of 00 to 00 thousand million dollars , " writes mr. <unk> .
nowhere can be found any mention that the government had to <unk> parliament before christmas to avoid being defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed relaunch plan .
another communication dated <unk> 0000 and signed by ambassador <unk> , warns washington about the increasingly negative image of the united states conveyed by drama series <unk> by <unk> .
the ambassador is worried by <unk> such as border , little mosque on the <unk> , <unk> and h <unk> , which contain <unk> references to <unk> <unk> , to the " no fly list " or again to kidnappings for rigorous <unk> by the cia .
another <unk> tells that during their first bilateral meeting , <unk> clinton asked her french opposite number <unk> <unk> , whether europe was ready to receive certain guantanamo prisoners .
<unk> <unk> replied " yes , " but on a case - by - case basis .
at the end of the meeting , he wrote , " he handed a paper to the secretary of state on the subject of omar <unk> , a <unk> aged 00 of canadian origin . "
" the secretary agreed to review the case . "
it should be noted in conclusion that tempers became heated about the <unk> website .
<unk> <unk> , an former adviser very close to <unk> <unk> , declared on <unk> waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be " <unk> . "
he echoed <unk> <unk> in the united states .
a worldwide plan for renewing lighting .
yesterday at <unk> <unk> put forward a plan of renovation of domestic , commercial and industrial lighting in 000 countries with a view to securing a reduction of greenhouse gases ( <unk> ) corresponding to almost one - third of the additional reduction needed to stabilise the planet 's climate by 0000 .
this ambitious plan is one of a number of concrete projects , which <unk> hopes to have adopted at <unk> to offset the absence of mandatory reduction undertakings by industrialised countries .
according to the plan tabled yesterday , if <unk> <unk> , which still hold 00 to 00 % of the market , were replaced by <unk> <unk> , or better still , by <unk> <unk> <unk> ( del or led in english ) , the bulk of the 0.0 thousand million tonnes of <unk> <unk> on the planet to provide <unk> for human beings , would be avoided .
<unk> is responsible for 0 % of worldwide emissions .
this is the equivalent of 00 % of the emissions by the world 's motor vehicles .
last year at copenhagen the high emissions countries such as the united states , china , europe and others including canada , adopted voluntary plans of reduction to bring down global emissions of <unk> from 00 <unk> to 00 <unk> .
but it will be necessary to <unk> from this figure a further 0 <unk> to stabilise the increase of climate warming by 0000 at 0°c in order to avoid loss of control .
in <unk> <unk> 00 % of energy is <unk> in the form of heat and only the remaining 0 % produce light .
with <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of energy is reduced by 00 % and with the new del <unk> , the energy requirement is <unk> reduced by double that amount .
<unk> <unk> last on an average between 0000 and 00 000 hours .
the new del <unk> such as those launched by <unk> this week , <unk> having <unk> participated in a <unk> study , have a life <unk> of 00 000 hours and consume 00 % less energy than <unk> <unk> , giving an idea of the saving , which would be possible in a plan of replacement applicable to 000 countries .
these entirely novel <unk> can also work with <unk> , emitting very little heat .
and they contain no mercury .
several specialists have voiced <unk> concerning <unk> <unk> , because they contain mercury and because it is necessary to dispose of them as dangerous waste , which is not always possible in developing countries , unless the manufacturers issue instructions .
but , states the report , the principal source of mercury emission on the planet is not the <unk> <unk> , but rather carbon thermal emission centres , which emit a lot of mercury to produce the electricity wasted in <unk> <unk> .
in the united states alone , these centres emit 00 000 tonnes of mercury a year .
the report details the gains , which every country would achieve through this international programme .
for example , <unk> would save a thousand million dollars a year on purchases of electricity and eight million tonnes of co 0 , the equivalent of 0.0 thermal centres , whose construction would cost 0.0 thousand million dollars .
ivory coast is <unk> expecting the announcement of the election results .
the <unk> secretary - general , ban ki - moon , has called for the publication " without delay " of the results of the ivory coast presidential election , on the expiry of the set period .
" the secretary - general stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay " stressed a spokesman for the head of <unk> . "
" he asks all ivory coast parties and institutions to show responsibility and to abstain from any initiatives pending the <unk> of the provisional results . "
despite pressures exerted by certain foreign governments , the electoral commission has allowed <unk> target date of wednesday midnight to pass , without publishing the results three days after the sunday voting .
about forty minutes before the expiry of the set period the president of the independent electoral commission " continued to work " on the <unk> of the results .
throughout the world , calls became more frequent on wednesday for the electoral commission finally to declare the name of the winner of the second round , <unk> <unk> or his <unk> <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> camp is counting <unk> he cancellation by the constitutional council of " fraudulent " votes in the north , received by the ex - rebels of the new forces ( <unk> ) since the failed coup <unk> in september 0000 .
pascal <unk> <unk> , campaign director of the ivory coast president , stated that the <unk> of intimidation of electors by the <unk> in the north of the country had <unk> the <unk> of the leaving president from voting .
any election could be annulled , if complaints by <unk> are accepted by the constitutional council .
<unk> 's enemies <unk> that the highest court of the <unk> is not impartial , since it is presided by paul <unk> <unk> , a close political ally of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the man from the north , who denies any links with the ex - rebels , has described as " unacceptable " the delay in making the announcement of the results and has asked <unk> to respect them , but has not gone so far as to claim victory .
his allies state that <unk> is blocking the publication of the results , because he knows that he lost and that complaining to the constitutional council after having prevented the electoral commission from publishing the results , would be illegal .
the second round of voting in the presidential election on sunday was thought to have <unk> the process of reunification and of reconciliation of a country split in two for years .
on wednesday <unk> warned the ivory coast political class that it might be held <unk> for any violence .
<unk> <unk> finished at the top in the first round on 00 october , with 00 % of votes against 00 % for <unk> <unk> , who received the public support of the former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 00 % in the <unk> round ) .
the rate of unemployment in france has remained stable in the <unk> quarter .
the rate of unemployment in france according to the international labour office has remained stable at 0.0 % in <unk> france ( 0.0 % taking into account overseas <unk> ) <unk> from data corrected for provisional seasonal variations ( <unk> ) published on thursday by the <unk> .
the number of unemployed is 0.000 million in <unk> france .
the data for the second quarter were confirmed at 0.0 % of <unk> working population and 0.0 of the <unk> .
over one year , unemployment has risen by 0.0 points .
seen more broadly , 0.0 million persons in <unk> france are not working during the third quarter but wish to work , whether they are , or are not available for work within two weeks and whether or not they are looking for work .
<unk> position of the young in the labour market has worsened with a fresh rise in the unemployment rate to 00.0 % in <unk> france ( + , 0.0 points over three months + 0.0 points over the year ) and 00 % including the <unk> .
in the third quarter , 000 000 young people between 00 and 00 were unemployed ( bit ) .
older people experienced a slight rise of unemployment to 0.0 % in <unk> france ( + 0.0 points over three months and over a year ) , equal to 000 000 persons of 00 or over and 0.0 % for the <unk> .
only the 00-00 benefited from stable unemployment in the third quarter being 0. , 0 % in <unk> france ( <unk> points over three months and + 0.0 <unk> a year ) and 0.0 % in the whole of france .
since 0000 , the <unk> no longer publishes the <unk> unemployment rate , following arguments about its method of calculation .
on the other hand , eurostat , the statistical agency of the <unk> union , continues to do so and on tuesday announced a rate of 0.0 % for france ( <unk> included ) in october after 0.0 % in september .
<unk> <unk> is under arrest
<unk> <unk> , 00 , director of waste processing companies and brother of the president of general council of <unk> - du - <unk> , was arrested and sent to <unk> prison near <unk> - en - <unk> in the context of an investigation of public contracts presumed fraudulent .
according to his <unk> , <unk> <unk> is accused of the abusive use of company property , the theft public funds , of receiving stolen goods , of active corruption and of the sale of influence .
" <unk> <unk> is <unk> and is willing to answer any questions which the <unk> may ask , but not <unk> . "
" it is easy to accuse him of a number of reprehensible actions , but quite another to prove them " declared his <unk> , florence <unk> , to <unk> , before her client 's hearing .

one of his <unk> , <unk> <unk> was also detained on <unk> <unk> <unk> .
according to his <unk> , me <unk> <unk> , his client never did anything other than perform his duties .
concerning the award of contracts or the destination of the related funds , he had no knowledge of them , said me <unk> .
in this matter , daniel <unk> , <unk> director - general of <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was detained for questioning on wednesday concerning the theft of public funds and complicity and released on police bail , coupled with a prohibition on meeting any persons involved in the case .
" my client has given explanations of the allegations against him . "
0 " the examining <unk> took this into account and did not deprive him of his freedom , " said his <unk> , me <unk> <unk> .
four other persons were detained for questioning and released during the night of tuesday to <unk> , two of them on bail , said the assistant public prosecutor , michel <unk> .
michel <unk> , assistant director - general of the <unk> marseille province <unk> ( <unk> ) is being prosecuted for " sale of influence and passive corruption . "
two functionaries of the <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , were arrested and <unk> one concerning the " theft of public property by a person responsible for public service " and the other concerning " complicity in the theft of public funds . "
lastly , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> was questioned concerning " receiving stolen company <unk> . "
among persons confronted with <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> - <unk> , <unk> arrested in a parallel affair concerning fraudulent public contracts involving <unk> .
<unk> suspect his companies of having served for large - scale money laundering .
the investigation is being conducted in the context of several court investigations of x in april 0000 following anonymous letters concerning presumed fraud relating to public contracts , in particular for waste disposal .
according to a source close to the inquiry , the investigations concentrate in particular on the conditions of the award and functioning of a discharge of la <unk> , which collects <unk> waste as well as the waste from certain towns of the urban community of marseille ( <unk> ) .
affair of <unk> <unk> : the <unk> has exaggerated the involvement of syria
during over ten months , from july 0000 to may 0000 , the fate of <unk> <unk> , the young french <unk> worker arrested in iran for " <unk> , " <unk> france hold its breath , alerted diplomacy and underlined the deterioration of <unk> between paris and teheran .
all under the careful scrutiny of united states diplomats .
american documents obtained by <unk> and consulted by le <unk> , reveal some of the background of this crisis .
they describe how the <unk> explained its strategy to the americans , going so far as to give them advice on the treatment of their own " hostage " in iran crises ( a small group of <unk> ) .
they show how the french authorities have tried to convince washington that the release of the young <unk> was not balanced by the release of <unk> <unk> , an iranian under arrest in france and sought by american justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the iranian nuclear programme .
lastly , they place in a glaring light the way in which the french presidency tried to manipulate the media to give credence of the idea that the syrian president , <unk> <unk> played a central part in the release of <unk> <unk> .
in reality , he had not done anything .
a diplomatic <unk> sent on 00 august 0000 to paris is entitled " iran : french comments on how to manage cases of hostages . "
the <unk> adviser on strategic matters , françois <unk> , accompanied by the director of <unk> <unk> for north africa and the middle east , <unk> <unk> , had a discussion with the american diplomat , <unk> <unk> .
they explained to her the french method .
they advised the americans to arrange to repatriate their own nationals detained in iran .
" make a lot of noise , " they said , " <unk> <unk> the words " fundamental rights of man , " " innocence " and " immediate release " in the media . "
" you must not <unk> the iranian regime , which is sensitive to its image . "
" do it all the more when the iranians ask you not to . "
because after attempts to discuss the matter through <unk> channels have failed , silence will not solve anything , the iranians being past - <unk> of delaying tactics . "
<unk> <unk> adds that <unk> foreigners is a familiar iranian tactic , taking hostages for political blackmail .
he announced that <unk> of <unk> <unk> from prison ( which will take place on 00 august , the day on which she took refuge in the french <unk> ) would involve paying the iranians a large sum of money ( 000 000 eur as a caution ) .
and he advised that the <unk> expected other hostage crises , a phenomenon which would get worse .
he said that the iranians might arrest in the near future another of some 0000 french citizens who live in iran .
<unk>
<unk> <unk> has been out of prison for twelve days , but is unable to leave iran .
a piece of information was <unk> : the iranian <unk> <unk> , whose extradition for illegal traffic in sensitive electronic material to iran the united states are demanding , was freed in paris by a court .
according to numerous observers , the american <unk> is considering this worrying coincidence .
for washington which <unk> iranian illegal nuclear material acquisition networks , the release of <unk> <unk> is bad news .
has france accepted a deal ?
the release of the iranian against that of the <unk> ?
during the conversation with <unk> <unk> on 0 september , françois <unk> gave an assurance that this was not the case .
he said that he <unk> was not only completely surprised by the judge 's ruling , but also tried to oppose it .
he said that there were lively exchanges <unk> the french presidency and and the garde des <unk> at the time , <unk> <unk> - marie . but the french government could not change the court ruling .
<unk> <unk> also wants to demonstrate that <unk> <unk> continues under close <unk> by the french secret service .
the <unk> adviser <unk> a number , hangs up and then <unk> the american diplomat that the iranian is currently in a paris building managed by the iranian <unk> .
during <unk> <unk> ' detention in iran , the <unk> did not control its efforts by means of <unk> and media " leaks " to create the impression that the syrian <unk> <unk> <unk> was playing the important and influential part of an intermediary .
the americans observe this activity without <unk> and find that manipulation bears fruit because several press articles repeat the official french version .
a telegram dated 00 august 0000 mentions the media " <unk> " by french officials .
on what is based so much " gratitude " <unk> to <unk> <unk> , asks the paris <unk> .
notwithstanding their declarations full of praise , french officials privately admit that they only have the <unk> notion of what the <unk> really did .
the document then deals with the reasons why the <unk> put out this fiction .
it states that the intensive effort of communication tries to validate sarkozy 's policy of moving closer to syria .
a policy launched in 0000 , which was seen by many critics in france and abroad as being premature and without merit .
by <unk> the part played by syria , paris is trying to show syria how much praise it could gain by playing a constructive part in the region .
the objective is also that of sowing <unk> of discord <unk> syria and iran .
the american <unk> knows this from a reliable source .
on 00 august , françois <unk> <unk> him that the french did not of course know whether the <unk> had done anything .. " <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> pas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> fait <unk> <unk> ce <unk> . "
but that they still thanked them .
this might at least confuse the iranians .
<unk> <unk> returns to france on 00 may 0000
nicolas sarkozy receives her at the <unk> .
in a <unk> , he thanks the presidents <unk> brazil , <unk> and syria for their " active role in favour of the release of our <unk> . "
no on - line games for young <unk> after midnight .
according to government authorities , the south <unk> <unk> will pass a law called " <unk> , " which will prohibit adolescents from playing on - line games after midnight by means of <unk> their access .
according to <unk> of the ministries of culture and family , a draft law will be submitted to parliament in december to ask on - line game companies to block access of <unk> under 00 to their games after midnight .
a lot of children play these games all night and then experience difficulties in studying at school and in living a normal life in <unk> .
" we think that this law is needed to ensure their health and their right to <unk> , " declared to <unk> <unk> <unk> , the minister in charge of <unk> the draft law .
on - line games will now be accessible at 0 a.m.
the minister stated that the companies would have one year to prepare themselves for the application of the law .
he added that the government would also ask the companies to limit the daily time of access to these games by young people whose parents have asked for this to be done .
he would also make available to people requesting it , free - of - charge software making it possible to limit time spent on internet .
south korea is one of the most " connected " countries and the newspapers regularly report various facts linked to an intensive use of the internet .
the country is also the undisputed champion of worldwide online game competitions .
in november , south korea won four gold <unk> at world <unk> games in a <unk> of 00 other nations .
world championships 0000-0000 : fifa <unk> organising countries .
<unk> due to suspected corruption . on thursday , the executive committee of fifa will appoint countries to organise world cup <unk> in 0000 and 0000 , an eminently <unk> choice , where influence and lobbying battles are liable to take precedence of technical criteria .
one thing is certain ; the 0000 edition of the fifa competition will take place in europe , the traditional bastion of the game ( 0 candidates , great britain , russia , spain - portugal and belgium - the netherlands ; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> - portugal , pays - <unk> - <unk> ) .
that of 0000 will be a lot more <unk> , fifa hoping to conquer new territories ( <unk> , australia ) after a first <unk> on the african continent in 0000 or to pursue its introduction into the usa , or the far east ( japan , south korea ) .
the list of personalities of the delegations ( david <unk> , price <unk> , jose luis <unk> <unk> , jose socrates , bill clinton , the <unk> of <unk> , the heads of the belgian and dutch governments , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) give an idea of the economic and political stakes of a world competition .
behind - the - scenes bargaining may therefore last up to the last minute .
for the rest , it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates .
according to a fifa assessment report , the british , spanish - portuguese ( 0000 ) and american ( 0000 ) cases advance better arguments than their competitors .
but these considerations will not weigh very heavily with the 00 members of the executive committee , when it comes to voting .
the sunday times <unk> <unk> resulted in the suspension of two members of the executive committee ( <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ) , might thus have ruined the chances of its country , the cradle of football , which only hosted the world cup once , in 0000 .
on monday the <unk> <unk> a documentary concerning three influential members of the executive committee , ricardo <unk> , nicolas <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
upsetting fifa and <unk> the british representatives , who engaged in intensive lobbying in recent weeks , mainly through david <unk> .
the head of the british government hopes to repeat the coup of his <unk> tony blair , who in 0000 secured the choice of london as the <unk> of the 0000 olympic games .
will this intensive activity suffice to <unk> the shield of england in the eyes of the executive committee ?
nothing is less certain , because the spain - portugal <unk> does not lack for advantages , with its <unk> already completed , its expertise ( world cup 00 in spain , 0000 olympic games in barcelona , euro 0000 in portugal ) and its football culture .
but the <unk> economic and financial prospects of the two countries could <unk> cold water on their ambitions .
possible reprisals against the british and doubts about the solvency of spain and portugal can only improve the standing of russia , which has become a powerful <unk> , despite its lacks ( <unk> , hotels , transport ) .
but the prime minister vladimir putin decided not to travel to <unk> and denounced " unfair competition in the preparation of voting " in a <unk> reference to accusations in the british press against members of the executive committee .
" they are being <unk> with <unk> and attempts are being made to compromise them , " alleged mr. putin .
concerning 0000 , the united states with <unk> of 0000 , appear the obvious <unk> .
the leading world <unk> power , the seat of the principal sponsors of fifa , the country appears to have a big lead over japan and south korea who have separately built a very fine project .
but these new <unk> appear premature for two countries , which jointly organised the 0000 trial .
another threat : the award of the 0000 world competition to china , <unk> desired by fifa , which will in fact <unk> asian chances for 0000 .
concerning <unk> which has made great play of proposing <unk> <unk> and australia , fifa would pursue its expansion into new regions , but these two countries offer more risk than certainty .
like japan and south korea , australia could also suffer from the weakness of tv rights of european countries , the nerve centre of the war for fifa .
second mandate : the evidence
de gaulle really hesitated .
<unk> made others believe that he hesitated .
<unk> giscard d'estaing and jacques chirac had not the slightest hesitation .
and nicolas <unk> still fewer than they .
an <unk> mandate tells a different story .
accordingly , the current head of state will be a candidate in 0000 .
but the evidence conflicts with the <unk> of the presidential function .
it is now necessary to pretend that the doubt had always existed .
in one sense as in the other .
in 0000 , even without believing it , friends of jacques chirac <unk> that a third mandate was not excluded .
on 00 november with a grave air , nicolas sarkozy gave an assurance that he would make his decision " <unk> in the autumn of 0000 "
the fact that on tuesday night at the <unk> before <unk> <unk> he called up the prospect of " two mandates " <unk> some <unk> reflections .
was this the official <unk> of his candidature ?
far from it .
the president only recalled that the 0000 revised <unk> limited the number of five - year terms to only two .
he stated facts , but he did not make an announcement .
this is not for the first time that he <unk> mentions the presidential election at such meetings .
he said in july 0000 that at best they only had another seven and a half years of him .
<unk> in may 0000 : do not believe that i only thought about it afterwards
his intentions of the day before yesterday did not make him any more or any less a candidate than those of the day before that .
if they occasion comments , the reason is twofold .
on the one hand , the acceleration of the progress of the candidature of the socialist party .
but it is not the entry into the lists of <unk> royal , which pushes nicolas sarkozy to <unk> himself .
the reason is , on the contrary , that his 0000 candidature is clearly what many members of the socialist party are calling for , an earlier plan of battle than one originally planned .
the bad polls , on the other hand .
for the first time , voters on the right preferred the candidature of françois <unk> to that of nicolas sarkozy ( 00 % against 00 % , according to <unk> - <unk> ) .
the <unk> of the prime minister immediately said that it had a candidate and that there was no debate about this within <unk> .
jean - pierre <unk> said that if he , the candidate , believed that defeat was a possibility , he would not be a candidate .
alain <unk> said in the face of evidence and by way of correction that the candidate would always believe that he could win .
euro : <unk> compelled to buy state securities
the last annual meeting of the board of governors of the european central bank ( <unk> ) had to be the occasion of specifying the methods of emerging from the crisis , or at least of announcing the end of a good number of unconventional monetary policy operations , which have to be completed by the year end .
the european sovereign debt crisis obliges the issuing institute in frankfurt to <unk> less <unk> , on pain of aggravating the situation , which is now more than tense enough already on european markets of obligation .
the political cost would be all the higher .
yesterday at a press conference , the french minister of finance , <unk> <unk> greeted the active role played by the <unk> to resolve the debt crisis of european states .
she did not wish to say whether she thought that the central bank had to do more , for example , by increasing its programme of buying sovereign <unk> .
she said that she would communicate her thoughts to her european partners .
in brussels on the day before during his hearing before the economic and monetary affairs commission of the european parliament , the chairman of the <unk> , jean - claude <unk> did not prove more diffuse about his intentions , <unk> himself with saying that the programme of buying state securities in the secondary market would continue and that they would see what will be decided at the meeting on thursday .
the only certainty : the <unk> would keep its principal rate of interest unchanged at 0 % , historically the lowest since may 0000 .
factually , the obligatory <unk> purchases by the <unk> doubled during last week to almost 0.00 thousand million euros .
and , according to <unk> of market operators , it made fresh purchases of irish and portuguese <unk> yesterday .
in total , <unk> central banks bought 00 thousand millions ' worth of euros since may 0000 .
there is no doubt among market operators about the expectations of a pursuit of purchases ( see page 00 ) .
economists no longer expect any marked change of cap.
whilst loan operations at over three months have already disappeared from the <unk> bank arsenal , the latter continues to grant unlimited cash loans on generous terms and for periods from one <unk> to three months .
economists now expect that the facility will be extended by some months .
michael <unk> , an economist at <unk> cannot imagine that it will modify it <unk> to any great extent .
he says that this would cause new short - term tensions .
<unk> <unk> , an economist at <unk> says that a gradual exit to be announced during the <unk> quarter of 0000 appears more likely .
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> adds that on the level of its interventions in the public debt market , the <unk> would have to make purchases of these <unk> adequately large to revive the <unk> market .
taking into account the large exposure of european banks to sovereign debt markets of the euro zone , the issuing institute has no option other than to maintain a presence in the market .
an important <unk> manager said yesterday that the bank must at all costs <unk> the shortage of investors in the market and prevent a boom of payments by the most vulnerable states .
because if interest rates take off , states will be all the more anxious to reduce their indebtedness , or to stabilise it .
this is the price of safeguarding the euro .
in italy , the <unk> government is turning its back .
after the start of a disquieting week for italy , the situation yesterday was somewhat easier with the <unk> of 00 - year obligatory rates .
return to precarious calm .
on leaving a meeting with the minister of the economy , the regional presidents said that <unk> <unk> described the situation as " insoluble " and that he was waiting for an unforeseeable weekend , which he subsequently denied .
in any event on tuesday the difference between german long - term rates reached a record of 000 base points and the price of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy ( cds ) took off to reach 000 points , producing a certain amount of panic in rome .
at a session of the council of ministers , <unk> <unk> pointed out that in spain the differential from german rates was over 000 base points .
but his right arm , <unk> <unk> , declared himself very worried by market turbulence and by a possible contagion from ireland .
the good news is that italy , the third largest economy of the eurozone , is not like greece and ireland .
according to <unk> <unk> , an <unk> at the <unk> institute , the bad news is that it is like portugal .
clearly , its problem is an absence of growth and inadequate tax revenues , placing the state in in danger of no longer being able to cover its financial requirements .
the most recent forecasts from brussels acted like a cold <unk> on the government .
italian growth is now expected to be 0.0 % in 0000 and 0.0 % in 0000 , <unk> the budget now under scrutiny by the senate records 0.0 and 0.0 % respectively .
under these conditions , the european commission calculates that the public deficit will be 0.0 % of the gdp next year ( versus 0.0 % forecast by the government ) and 0.0 % in 0000 ( instead of the forecast of 0.0 % ) .
this is the reason for the rumour of a new collective budget of 0 thousand million euros , which might be drawn up after the holidays .
the economic affairs commissioner <unk> rehn said that if necessary , new austerity measures will have to be taken .
for the moment , italy receives support from international institutions .
<unk> <unk> , the italian <unk> of the international monetary fund in charge of italy at the <unk> <unk> that the foundations of italian economy are sound .
<unk> carlo <unk> , chief economist of <unk> , states that there is no problem in the immediate future , in the short or in the long term , because despite its large debt ( 000.0 % of <unk> in 0000 , <unk> ) . stabilisation efforts demanded from italy are smaller than those demanded from other countries .
there remains the question of political instability .
on 00 december , <unk> <unk> will face a motion of censure in the chamber of <unk> , following which an early general election could take place at the end of march .
a period not suited to the taking of decisions in the event of a serious crisis would then begin .
europeans are thinking about means of strengthening anti - crisis devices .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the following home yesterday at a press conference in paris : she said that she believed europeans showed on sunday both day and night that they are committed to defend their currency and their monetary zone .
although that it was only relative , the <unk> recorded here yesterday of interest rates on european state <unk> brought water to the mills of governments and of the <unk> .
but one cannot yet speak about a start of normalisation .
the standard & poor agency announced that it might devalue the portuguese debt , the target of most of today 's speculation .
the economists of <unk> <unk> <unk> feel that as in may , there is a real lack of clarity and political transparency <unk> banking systems in particular .
all the more because political time moves much more slowly than market time .
aware of this gap and of the dangers which it conceals , european countries are intensifying their discussions aimed at strengthening their existing anti - crisis devices .
informal consultations between ministers of finance of countries most directly concerned and more widely their g 00 opposite numbers , are well advanced .
and also in the expectation of meetings of the eurogroup and the ecofin at the start of next week .
the <unk> is meeting today .
on the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures of support for countries of the eurozone in the market <unk> ( see above ) .
concerning the european financial stability fund ( <unk> ) its executive director klaus <unk> began a tour of asia starting from singapore , to inform far east investors about the progress of the crisis i europe .
whilst the object of these visits is not to raise funds , it is certainly intended to prepare the ground for doing so .
the first issues of <unk> <unk> are expected to take place next month .
yesterday , an official american representative told <unk> that the united states would support a possible increase of funds for direct supplementary involvement of the <unk> .
front line <unk> such as spain and portugal are preparing to adopt structural reforms , particularly concerning organisation of the labour market .
reforms which are additional to measures of austerity with a more rapid effect .
lisbon and madrid wish to embark on a path different from that taken by greece and ireland .
both are anxious to avoid in any circumstances asking for international help , before introducing its own budgetary <unk> and deciding on structural reforms essential for restoring long - term confidence .
lastly , <unk> of european funds are discussing available options to speed up the process of normalisation of sovereign debt markets .
in paris on 00 november , <unk> weber first put forward the idea that if the 000 thousand million euros released by europe and the <unk> were not adequate , the <unk> would not hesitate to resort to the portfolio .
economists at <unk> capital , a top <unk> sovereign debt market player , feel that an increase of about 000 thousand million euros , preferably in the form of a direct cash injection , would suffice .
the vehicle exists : the vehicle exists in the form of the european financial stabilisation mechanism , currently containing 00 thousand million euros .
a piece of advice likely to be examined carefully in european capitals .
most importantly , if market conditions prevail .
snow and ice : 00 <unk> have received an orange warning .
<unk> of snow are still causing traffic problems , especially in the secondary network in <unk> and may disrupt certain economic activities .
twenty - four <unk> are on orange alert due to a risk of snow and ice .
<unk> , <unk> - et - <unk> , <unk> - <unk> ad <unk> have joined the 00 <unk> already on orange alert , 00 since wednesday afternoon and two , <unk> and <unk> , later during the night .
according to <unk> france , continuous <unk> of snow are affecting the north of the <unk> and both <unk> and it is <unk> lightly over the <unk> de france .
deposits of snow from 0 to 0 <unk> , 0 to 00 <unk> in places , are expected in the <unk> in question and 0 to 0 <unk> , indeed up to 0 <unk> in the paris region .
the <unk> in question are <unk> , <unk> - maritime , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and those of the regions of <unk> - <unk> , <unk> - de - france and limousin .
according to <unk> france , snow <unk> are sufficiently marked to create traffic problems and to disrupt certain economic activities .
in <unk> <unk> , access to vehicles of over 0/0 tonnes to several major roads is <unk> , including the <unk> - <unk> and the saint - <unk> - <unk> roads .
traffic on the <unk> secondary network is very difficult and the <unk> recommends that vehicles should only be used where absolutely necessary . traffic of certain <unk> <unk> has been suspended for the day .
in <unk> , all school transport on thursday has been prohibited .
no special measures are contemplated for wednesday evening to restrict the traffic of heavy loads .
the <unk> asks all drivers to exercise the greatest possible care on roads and to adapt their driving accordingly .
the directorate - general of civil aviation ( <unk> ) has asked all air transport companies to <unk> on thursday 00 % of their flights to <unk> airport and 00 % to <unk> airport , due to expected snowfall .
the <unk> recommends air passengers to contact their carrier .
in great britain , gatwick airport in south london and edinburgh airport in scotland will be closed until thursday morning .
metro grand paris : first financial proposals ;
since the time when the debate about the modernisation of transport in the <unk> - de - france reached its highest point , thousands of millions of euros have been <unk> .
in the discussion of means .
mention is made in particular of the 00 thousand million euros for the grand paris metro which the grand paris company is to build .
to start this <unk> , the state announced a contribution of 0 <unk> million euros .
in the theoretical scheme , it is this sum which will then enable the <unk> to borrow in the market a part of the financing of its double <unk> .
today . the first calculations have begun .
the 0000 law concerning <unk> financing examined by the parliamentary finance commission this morning , contains the devices needed for finding the initial sum .
there are two of them : the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase of the tax on offices in the <unk> - de - france .
the first , says article 00 of the draft law is " for the establishment of the grand paris company . "
<unk> <unk> <unk> : it says : the yield of this tax is 000 million euros annually .
the second is a recasting of a tax on <unk> which exists already " in order to modernise , to increase its yield and to allocate this increase to the grand paris company . "
how much will this will bring in ?
mystery .
this does not figure in the text .
it falls far short of the 0 thousand million .
the expose states that tax resources are additional to the 0 thousand million euros of capital to be invested by the state and passed to the grand paris company as the project progresses .
<unk> does not find this system shocking .
it is explained that from the moment the two sources of cash were created ( the two taxes , <unk> ) it would be possible to cover the cost of three years of study and then resort to the 0 thousand million euros .
" this would be included in the budget and drawn on as the project develops "
the <unk> estimates that the 0 thousand million euros would be included in 0000 in the 0000 budget .
this device , in which the promised 0 thousand million euros are already included , may give rise to a somewhat <unk> parliamentary debate .
first public session on 0 december .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> are waiting .
the <unk> affair has a double significance .
on the one hand , it is a scandal , which only looked scandalous in the light of the hypocrisy which prevails in relations between states , citizens and the press .
on the other hand , it <unk> profound changes on international level and points to a future dominated by regression .
but let us take things in the right order .
the first aspect of <unk> is a confirmation of the fact that every secret service case ( of any country ) consists solely of press <unk> .
the " extraordinary " american <unk> about the sexual habits of <unk> only report what it was possible to read for months in any daily ( except in those belonging to <unk> ) and the <unk> caricature profile of <unk> has long been a <unk> <unk> material .
the rule according to which secret files may only contain already known news is essential for secret services dynamic and not only in the present century .
if you visit a <unk> devoted to american <unk> , you will see that every work repeats ( concerning the <unk> , the mystery of <unk> - le - <unk> , the <unk> , or the <unk> ) exactly that which was already set out in earlier works .
and this is so not only because the author of <unk> texts does not like to do previously <unk> research ( and does not know where to look for news about what does not exist ) , but because those who devote <unk> to <unk> , do not believe what they already know and which confirms what they had already learned .
this is <unk> brown 's success mechanism .
the same applies to secret files .
the <unk> is <unk> and <unk> ( or limited ) is also the head of secret service ( otherwise he could be , for all i know , an editor at liberation ) , who does not consider to be true what he recognises .
top secret information about <unk> , which the <unk> <unk> in rome sent to the state department , was the same as that which <unk> had published the week before .
so why did the <unk> about these files make so much noise ?
on the one hand , they say that every cultivated person already knows that embassies have , at least since the end of the second world war and since heads of state could telephone one another or fly to meet for <unk> , lost their diplomatic function and except for some little representation exercises , have become centres of <unk> .
every <unk> of investigation films knows this very well and it is hypocritical to pretend that he does not .
nevertheless , repeating it in public breaches the duty to be hypocritical and only places american diplomacy in a bad light .
secondly , the idea of a <unk> being able to acquire the deepest secrets of the most powerful country in the world represents a significant blow to the prestige of the state department .
the scandal affects both the victims and the " <unk> " equally .
but let us look at the <unk> nature of what has happened .
<unk> , in the days of orwell , one could see all power as big brother , who controlled every action of his subjects .
the orwellian <unk> proved completely true , since being able to be completely controlled thanks to the telephone , the hotel visited , the <unk> taken and so on , the citizen became a total victim of the eye of power .
but when one demonstrates what happens now , that even the secrets of power <unk> escape the control of a <unk> , the control report ceases to be unidirectional and is able to circulate .
power controls every citizen , but every citizen , or at least the <unk> as the citizen 's <unk> , can learn all the secrets of power .
how can a power last , if it can no longer keep its secrets ?
it is true , as george <unk> has already said that a real secret is an empty secret and can never be discovered ; it is also true that knowing everything about the character of <unk> or of merkel is a secret devoid of secrecy , because it is in the public domain , but to disclose , as <unk> has done , that the secrets of <unk> <unk> were empty secrets , means taking away all her power .
<unk> did not injure sarkozy or merkel , but did considerably injure clinton and <unk> .
what will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful entity ?
clearly , in future , states will no longer be able to place on line secret information , which would be like <unk> it on a street corner .
but it is also clear that with current technologies it is useless to hope to be able to discuss confidential reports on the telephone .
nothing is easier than to discover if and when a head of state has flown away and to contact one of his / her colleagues .
how can private and confidential reports be discussed in the future ?
i know very well that for the moment my forecast is science fiction and <unk> , but i have to imagine government agents who travel discreetly by routes which cannot be checked and that they have learned messages by heart , or have concealed written information in the heel of a <unk> .
the information will be on a single copy kept in a locked <unk> ; basically , the attempted <unk> <unk> was less <unk> than <unk> . au fond , la <unk> <unk> du <unk> a eu <unk> de <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i had occasion to write that technology goes forward like a <unk> , namely , backwards .
a century after the invention of wireless <unk> <unk> communications , internet re - established wire <unk> ( telephone ) .
video <unk> ( <unk> ) had enabled cinema research workers to explore a film step - by - step going backward and forward and discovering all the secrets of <unk> , whilst digital <unk> 's only allow jumping from chapter to chapter , <unk> by <unk> .
with high - speed trains one can travel from rome to milan in three hours , whilst going by air a total of three - and - a - half hours are needed .
is it therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques revert to horse - drawn carriages .
a last observation .
in other days the press tried to understand what was happening in secret in embassies .
now it is embassies which ask the press for <unk> information .
climate : how france <unk> with its promises of finance .
a year after the copenhagen agreement it is time to look at the observance of the promises of fast finance ( so - called fast start finance ) by developed countries .
and large - scale <unk> <unk> to light .
according to the copenhagen <unk> , developed countries <unk> to <unk> 00 thousand million dollars between 0000 and 0000 .
the european union promised 0.0 thousand million euros over three years and france 0.00 thousand million euros ( 000 million a year ) .
when cop 00 opened , the european union tried to persuade its partners of the authenticity of its commitment to rapid start finance , submitting a report detailing the actions of its member - states , press <unk> , major side events , the distribution of <unk> ... <unk> <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> de <unk> , grand side event , distribution de <unk> ...
the operation transparency is <unk> and appreciated at its just value : developing countries and the civil society are doing the same and at the same level of precision . <unk> pays en <unk> et la <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pays <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> un <unk> <unk> de <unk> .
the european union <unk> having allocated in 0000 0.0 thousand million euros , a good token of observance of its promise of 0.0 thousand million euros in 0000 .
but looking at details , things are more complicated .
this money must , according to the copenhagen <unk> , be " new and additional " to ensure that a supplementary effort is made without detriment to public development assistance .
unfortunately , there is no agreement about what " new and additional " means .
now that the european commission has proposed a harmonisation , certain member - states including france have blocked the procedure .
today , everyone chooses what suits him / it best .
the european commission , for example , took for its reference the year 0000 ; international finance is maintained and it is adding 000 <unk> over 0 years as fast start finance . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , et <unk> y <unk> 000 millions <unk> <unk> <unk> au <unk> des <unk> fast start .
other countries chose similar references in terms of year , or of level of public development assistance .
on the contrary , france regards the financing of all 0000 new projects as " new and additional projects . "
in other words , there is no reference to the costs of the preceding years , or globally , of public development assistance .
concretely , the total support given by france to developing countries can remain stable ( or even decrease ) , france maintains that it is observing its commitment in <unk> of " new and additional " finance .
another crucial element , the separation of gifts and loans .
there , again , there is no rule and everyone chooses his own method of calculation .
some , like france , consider that a euro lent is equal to a euro <unk> .
clearly , this is difficult to justify ; the effort is not <unk> . <unk> <unk> pas comparable .
if the custom of loans can be justified for certain investments which are profitable ( often projects linked to emissions which rely on more efficient technologies ) it is fallacious to call a euro which one will recoup as a <unk> euro .. in <unk> , only the cost of a loan to the lender country should be taken into <unk> as its commitment ( equal to the rate of interest ) .
but france need only reason that it " <unk> " it commitment of 000 million euros making 00.0 % of loans ( 000.0 million euros ) and 0.0 % of <unk> ( 00.0 million euros ) - see european union document for your own <unk> . <unk> " <unk> " son engagement de 000 millions <unk> en <unk> 00,0 % de <unk> ( <unk> millions <unk> ) et <unk> % de <unk> ( 00,0 millions <unk> ) - <unk> le document de <unk> <unk> <unk> par <unk> - <unk> .
it is the only country of the union to use loans on such a massive scale .
germany is lending 00 % , whilst denmark , the netherlands and slovakia ( among others ) observe their <unk> with 000 % as <unk> .
in other words , when the great majority of the european union gives 0 euro to meet its commitment , france only gives 00 <unk> and regards its effort as comparable .
a nice sleight of hand !
summing up , france operates , in its fast start finance , double blackmail : on the one hand , on the evolution of the action over time and the other hand , on the reality of the financial effort . <unk> part <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> le <unk> et <unk> part <unk> la <unk> de <unk> <unk> .
by only spending 00.0 million euros it thinks that it is generating a belief to be spending 000 million " new and additional " euros as it promised .
the manipulation of the ministry of finance ( because it appears that it is <unk> that implemented the <unk> ) could have a doubly negative impact , both within the european union ( why should the other member - states continue to give , if lending is sufficient ? ) and in the negotiations , since the developing countries are not completely <unk> <unk>
the early finance chapter is only a small , relatively short - term matter in relation to all the discussions about the climate .
but it could be <unk> more grain of sand in the huge machine , the <unk> .
let us hope that this is not the case .
in any event , it is essential to draw lessons from this first year of early finance .
first of all , france could announce a change in its method of accountancy for 0000 and 0000 in a spirit of honouring its commitments and of equity with other european union countries .
but above all , france could promote the discussions about long - term financing stakes ( another crucial chapter currently being discussed ) ; it is not possible to avoid the question of " <unk> " or of the method of accountancy of loans . on <unk> pas à la question de " <unk> " <unk> du mode de <unk> des <unk> .
france could change its position to become as <unk> on these stakes as it it on others .
the hope therefore rests on the new minister of the environment , mme <unk> - <unk> who will arrive in <unk> next week .
a surprise announcement on france 's fast start and on the view of " <unk> " and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed for progress in these discussions .
alert on pesticides consumed by children .
according to a study published o wednesday by the future generations association ( <unk> movement for the rights and respect of future generations ) , a child of 00 consumes in one day 00 different chemical substances .
the association which predicts that its results do not possess , in view of the small number of <unk> analysed , any significant statistical value , but illustrate the problem being dealt with , has bought in <unk> of the <unk> and of paris between july and september , the <unk> of foodstuffs generally consumed in four <unk> by a child of ten .
these <unk> <unk> official recommendations , five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables , three dairy products and 0.0 litres of water as well as <unk> , were examined by <unk> research laboratories dealing with chemicals , pesticides , heavy metals and other pollutants .
the balance sheet is staggering : 00 chemical substances including 00 classified as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five classified as definitely carcinogenic , as well as 00 substances able to induce endocrine disorders , according to studies by several institutions such as the international cancer research centre .
according to the <unk> , even if , in almost all cases , the legal limits of each chemical substance are not exceeded , our inquiry shows that the reality of exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic <unk> is worrying .
for breakfast , butter and <unk> with milk alone contain over ten possible and three proven carcinogenic residues and almost twenty residues potentially able to disturb the <unk> system .
an apple from brazil contains traces of six chemical substances <unk> a <unk> , prohibited in france .
the same applies to beans from <unk> included in a <unk> , in which the study found traces of a powerful <unk> prohibited in the european union .
in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> tuna and even a <unk> and chewing <unk> contained pesticides and other chemicals .
<unk> contained nitrates and <unk> .
for <unk> , <unk> <unk> was the " richest , " with 00 chemical residues and even the plastic plate used for warming the meal in a <unk> , was not exempt .
according to the study , the final risk for the consumer in this " <unk> cocktail " is probably underestimated .
for its part , the european ecology alliance - the greens proposed , in view of the urgency of the situation , the introduction of a moratorium on the use of pesticides , in order to stop the growth of civilisation 's diseases .
in july , a study by the european food safety agency pointed to the presence of residues of 000 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in europe including 00 in cereals .
